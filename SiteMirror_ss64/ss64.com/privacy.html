<p>SS64.com are committed to protecting your privacy and to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We hope that this Privacy Policy  helps you understand what kind of information we collect in connection with our products and services and how we process such information. Throughout this Policy the term &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; means information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (i.e. a natural person).</p>
<h2>Log Files</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For the most part, you may visit our websites or use our products or services without having to tell us who you are. However, certain technical information is normally collected as a standard part of your use of our services. Such information includes, for example, your IP-address, access times, the website you linked from and the pages you visit.</p>
<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our site and servers and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. It is possible that personal information about a customer may be included in the log files due to the normal functions of IP addresses and Web browsing. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Sharing</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not share your data with others except as necessary to provide services, or in response to court-issued subpoenas or search warrants. In order to protect our legal interests, in the event of a subpoena or search warrant, SS64 may voluntarily provide to all legal authorities any and all information requested, with or without contacting you. </p>
</blockquote>
