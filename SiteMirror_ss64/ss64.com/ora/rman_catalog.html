<p>Add information about a datafile copy, archived redo log, or control file copy to the repository.</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;  CATALOG {ARCHIVELOG | BACKUPPIECE | CONTROLFILECOPY | DATAFILECOPY} '<i>FileName</i>'â€¦ [LEVEL = <i>Integer</i>];

&nbsp;  CATALOG RECOVERYAREA [NOPROMPT]

&nbsp;  CATALOG DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST [NOPROMPT]

&nbsp;  CATALOG START WITH 'string pattern' [NOPROMPT]

Key

   ARCHIVELOG 'filename'  The filename of an archived log to be added to
                          or updated in the RMAN repository.

   BACKUPPIECE            The name of a backup piece to be added to the RMAN repository.
                          The backup piece must be on disk.
                          RMAN verifies the backup piece header before cataloging it. RMAN can catalog a backup piece from a prior incarnation.
</pre>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically, you would catalog a backup piece in the following situations:<br>
<br>
You have copied a backup piece with an operating system utility. In this case, the original backup piece is cataloged but the piece copy is not.<br>
You want to move a backup piece from one disk to another under a different absolute filename.<br>
You run in NOCATALOG mode and must re-create the control file, thereby losing all RMAN metadata.<br>
<br>
If you specify a list of backup pieces, RMAN catalogs all pieces in the given list even if one of them fails. Cataloging a backup piece creates a new row in V$BACKUP_PIECE. A backup set is only usable when all backup pieces are cataloged. Otherwise it would be in partially available state.<br>
<br>
Note: When cataloging backup pieces from releases prior to Oracle9i, performance improves when you catalog higher copy numbers first. For example, if you need to catalog copies 1, 2, and 3 of a backup piece, then specify copy 3 as the first item in the CATALOG list.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<pre>   CONTROLFILECOPY        The filename of a control file copy to be added to
                          or updated in the RMAN repository.</pre>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The control file copy can be:<br>
A copy of a normal control file (that is, not a standby control file) created with the RMAN command BACKUP AS COPY CURRENT CONTROLFILE command or the SQL statement ALTER DATABASE BACKUP CONTROLFILE<br>
A standby control file copy created with the RMAN command BACKUP AS COPY STANDBY CONTROLFILE or the SQL statement ALTER DATABASE CREATE STANDBY CONTROLFILE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<pre>   DATAFILECOPY           The filename of a datafile copy to be added to or
                          updated in the RMAN repository.
   LEVEL = 0              For datafile copies only, indicates that the copy should be
                          recorded as a level 0 incremental backup.
                          Perform incremental backups by using this datafile copy as the base level 0 backup.

   (RECOVERY AREA |
   DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST)
   [ NOPROMPT ]           Catalog all valid backup sets, datafile copies, and
                          archived redo logs in the flash recovery area.
                          RMAN must be connected to the target database and the target database
                          must be mounted or open.
                          Specify NOPROMPT if you do not want to be prompted after every match.
                          The keywords RECOVERY AREA and DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST are exact synonyms.

   START WITH '<i>string_pattern</i>' [ NOPROMPT ]
</pre>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Catalogs all valid backups in the specified location, which can be an Automatic Storage Management disk group, Oracle Managed Files directory, or part of a filename. RMAN will report any files in the disk location that cannot be cataloged. RMAN must be connected to the target database and the target database must be mounted. Specify NOPROMPT if you do not want to be prompted after every match.<br>
<br>
If the string pattern specifies a filename, then it matches the left part of the filename pattern. For example, /tmp/arc matches everything in directory /tmp/arc_dest and /tmp/archive/january as well as a file /tmp/arc.cpy.<br>
<br>
Note: You cannot use wildcard characters.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Examples</b></span></p>
<p>Catalog all files and the contents of directories which begin with the pattern &quot;e:\backup\Live\&quot;<br>
<span class="code">RMAN&gt; CATALOG start with 'e:\backup\Live\';</span></p>
<p>Catalog all files in the current recovery area.<br>
<span class="code">RMAN&gt; CATALOG RECOVERY AREA NOPROMPT;</span></p>
