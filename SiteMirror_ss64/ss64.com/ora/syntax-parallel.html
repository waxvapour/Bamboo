<p>  Server processes handle each user process request.
    Server processes communicate with the other Oracle <a href="syntax-instance.html">background
    processes</a> to
  read
and write data.</p>
<p>In a <i>dedicated server </i>configuration,
    a server process handles requests for a  single user process. In a shared
    server configuration a server process can handle requests from multiple user
    processes, this often allows better  use of available system resources. </p>
<p>Client/server systems separate the user and server processes and
    execute them on different machines.</p>
<p>  Oracle's shared server architecture increases the scalability of applications
    and the number of clients simultaneously connected to the database.<br>
  The number of
  shared server processes that can be created ranges between the values of the
initialization parameters SHARED_SERVERS and MAX_SHARED_SERVERS.</p>
<p>  Certain administrative activities cannot be performed while connected to
      a dispatcher process, including shutting down or starting an instance and
      media
    recovery. <br>
  To connect with administrator privileges in a system configured
    with shared servers, you must state in the connect string: SERVER=DEDICATED</p>
<p><b>Parallel Processing</b><br>
  
  When Oracle executes SQL statements in parallel, multiple processes work together
  simultaneously to execute a single SQL statement. By dividing the work  among
    multiple processes, Oracle can execute the statement more quickly,  this
    is called parallel execution or parallel processing.</p>
<p>During business hours, most OLTP systems should probably not use parallel
  execution. During off-hours, however, parallel execution can effectively process
  high-volume batch operations. Complex queries,<br>
  such as those involving joins or searches of very large tables, are often best
  executed in parallel.</p>
<p>You can use hints in a query to force the degree of parallelism (DOP) of each
  table, though in
general, you should let the query optimizer determine this. Each SQL statement
undergoes  optimization when it is parsed. Therefore,
the query optimizer will automatically adapt
  to improve performance.</p>
<p>In addition to queries, DDL and DML you can parallelize the use of SQL*Loader,
  where large amounts of data are routinely encountered. To speed up your loads,
  you can use a parallel direct-path load with the option: PARALLEL=TRUE</p>
<p><b>Parallel Query</b><br>
  To achieve parallelism for SQL query statements, one or more of the tables
being scanned should have a <a href="table_c.html">parallel</a> attribute.</p>
<p><b>Parallel DDL</b><br>
  To achieve parallelism for SQL DDL statements, the <a href="table_c.html">parallel</a> clause should be
specified.</p>
<p>  <b>Parallel DML</b><br>
  Due to the differences in locking between serial and parallel DML, you must
    explicitly enable parallel DML before you can use it. <br>
    To  enable parallel
  DML in your session: <br>
  <a href="session_a.html">ALTER SESSION</a> ENABLE PARALLEL DML;<br>
  Then any DML issued against a table with a parallel attribute will occur in
parallel,</p>
<p><b>Database Resource Manager</b><br>
  The Database Resource Manager controls the distribution of server resources
    among sessions by controlling the execution schedule inside the database
    (it does not enforce CPU allocation percentage limits as long as consumer
groups are getting the resources they need.)</p>
<p>To create a resource plan use the PL/SQL package <a href="../orap/DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER.html">DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER</a> <br>
  (create,
  update, and delete resource plans and resource consumer groups.)</p>
<p>  Assign plans to a user with <a href="../orap/DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER_PRIVS.html">DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER_PRIVS</a><br>
  Also see <a href="../orap/DBMS_SESSION.html">DBMS_SESSION</a>.SWITCH_CURRENT_CONSUMER_GROUP</p>
<p>To activate a resource plan<br>
  <a href="system_a.html">ALTER SYSTEM</a> SET RESOURCE_MANAGER_PLAN ='MYPLAN';<br>
  Or modify INIT.ORA to include the following line:<br>
  RESOURCE_MANAGER_PLAN=' MYPLAN'</p>
<p>To disable<br>
  <a href="system_a.html">ALTER SYSTEM</a> SET RESOURCE_MANAGER_PLAN='';</p>
<p>On UNIX platforms, do not use the <a href="../bash/nice.html">nice</a> command
  to alter the operating-system run priorities of processes. Use of this
  command can lead to severe instability and unpredictable behavior of the
Oracle Server. </p>
<p>HP's Process Resource Manager (PRM) or Sun's Solaris Resource Manager (SRM)
  are supported under specific conditions (listed in the Oracle documentation.)
  If you use one of these OS resource controls, make sure you don't also enable
  the Oracle Database Resource Manager.</p>
