<h2> Overview</h2>
<p>  A schema is a set of objects owned by a user, A user automatically has all
    object privileges for schema objects contained in his or her schema. A user
    can grant any object privilege on any schema object
he or she owns to any other user or role.</p>
<p>  A privilege can be granted  explicitly. For example, the privilege
    to insert records into the EMP table can be explicitly granted to the user
    SCOTT.<br>
  Alternatively a privilege can be granted to a role (a named group of privileges),
  and then the role can be granted to one or more users. <br>
  For example, the privilege
    to insert records into the EMP table can be granted to the role named CLERK,
    which
  in turn can be granted to the users SCOTT and BRIAN.</p>
<p>The SQL statements <a href="grant.html">GRANT</a> and <a href="revoke.html">REVOKE</a>, respectively allow /disallow access.</p>
<h2>Three Schema Security Model</h2>
<p>  Typically all database tables
      are stored in a single schema - security options are then set to grant
other schemas/users access to the data.</p>
<p>The 'Three Schema Security Model' for database security:</p>
<p>Level 1 Schema - Owns all application data tables. e.g. APP_DATA<br>
  Level 2 Schema - Owns Views and Packages needed to access the application data
    e.g. APP_CODE<br>
  Level 3 Schema - Used for application users to connect to the database. e.g.
  APP_USER</p>
<p>This arrangement makes it easy to do imports and exports<br>
  e.g. <br>
  A USER level EXPORT of APP_DATA will export all the data but not Views, Packages
  or Procedures.<br>
  A USER level IMPORT of APP_CODE will update the application code without affecting
  any data.</p>
<p>To make this work will require some permissions to be set:</p>
<p>Level 1 Schema - Grant the required SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE privileges to the
  Level 2 Schema.</p>
<p>Level 2 Schema - Objects in this schema use privileges granted by the first
  schema to access the data.</p>
<p>Level 3 Schema - Uses privileges granted and objects created by the second
  schema to access the data.</p>
<p>None of the 3 schemas should be given full DBA permissions.<br>
  Application users should never be allowed to connect to the database via a
    'single' schema that owns all data and objects.</p>
<p>Rather than the 'level 3 schema' being a single schema/logon/password, you
  can choose to implement multiple schemas, one for each user - in this case
  privileges
  should be granted to each level 3 schema using a ROLE.</p>
<h2>ROLES</h2>
<p>  Any role can be granted to any database user.</p>
<p><a href="grant.html">GRANT</a> role TO [user,] [role,]</p>
<p>Each role granted to a user is, at a given time, either enabled or disabled.
  This can be used to provide selective availability of privileges.</p>
<p>A role can be granted to other roles (an indirect grant.)<br>
  However, a role cannot be granted
  to itself and cannot be granted circularly. For example, role A cannot be granted
  to role B if role B has previously been granted to role A.<br>
  <br>
  An indirectly granted role can be explicitly
    enabled or disabled for a user. However, by enabling a role that contains
      other roles, you implicitly enable all indirectly granted roles of the
      directly granted
    role.<br>
  <br>
  The following default roles are provided only for backward compatibility with
  earlier versions of Oracle:<br>
  CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA, EXP_FULL_DATABASE, IMP_FULL_DATABASE<br>
  It is recommended
  that you create new roles to suit the specific needs of your application.</p>
<p>  A role can be granted <i>system </i>or <i>schema object </i>privileges.</p>
<p>A <i>schema object </i>privilege is a privilege or right to perform a particular
  action on a specific schema object, different object privileges are available
  for different
types of schema objects. </p>
<p>A <i>system</i> privilege is the right to perform a particular action, or to perform
  an action on any schema objects of a particular type. There are over 60 distinct
  system privileges.</p>
<p>Selective privileges are used to restrict a user's INSERT and UPDATE privileges
  to sensitive data.<br>
  With selective UPDATE, a user can update only specific columns of a row. <br>
  With
  selective INSERT, a user can insert a row with values for the selected
  columns. All other columns receive NULL or the
  column's
  default value.<br>
  <br>
  To use a view, you require appropriate privileges only for the view itself.
You do not require privileges on base objects underlying the view.</p>
<p>Views add two more levels of security for tables, column-level security and
  value-based security:<br>
  A view can provide access to selected columns of base tables and also displays
  only selected rows (if a WHERE clause is used in the definition of the view)</p>
<h2>Privileges to run code</h2>
<p><b>Invoker Rights</b> - An invoker-rights procedure executes with
  all of the invoker's roles and privileges. This is also the default for anonymous
  PL/SQL
  blocks.</p>
<p>When using Invoker Rights the invoker needs privileges at runtime to
    access program references
  embedded in 
  DML statements or dynamic SQL statements.</p>
<p><b>Definer Rights</b> - A user of a definer-rights procedure requires
    only the privilege to execute the procedure; not on the underlying objects
    that
      the procedure accesses, because a definer-rights procedure operates under
      the security domain of the user who owns the procedure, regardless of who
  is executing it. </p>
<p>When using Definer Rights it's essential that the procedure's owner has all
  the necessary object privileges for all referenced objects. </p>
<p>Fewer privileges have to be granted to users of a definer-rights procedure,
resulting in tighter control of database access. See the <i>PL/SQL
User's Guide and Reference</i> for more.</p>
<h2>  Secure Application Roles</h2>
<p>  Secure application roles can only be enabled by authorized PL/SQL packages.
    This mechanism restricts the enabling of roles to the invoking application.
    Application developers no longer need
  to secure a role by embedding passwords inside applications. Instead, they
  create a secure application role and<br>
specify which PL/SQL package is authorized to enable the role.</p>
<p><a href="role_c.html">CREATE ROLE</a> admin_role IDENTIFIED USING hr.admin;</p>
<p>Because of the restriction that users can not change security domain inside
  Definer's Right procedures, secure application roles can only be enabled inside
  Invoker's Right procedures.</p>
<h2>  User Settings and Quotas</h2>
<p>  Oracle provides a way to direct and limit the use of disk space allocated to the database for each user, including default and temporary tablespace and
tablespace quota.<br>
Each user is assigned a <b>profile</b> that can limit the system resources available to the user.<br>
e.g. 
Number of concurrent sessions,
CPU processing
time, amount of logical I/O.</p>
<p>Oracle can lock a user's account if a specified number of password attempts fail. Depending on how the account is configured, it can be unlocked automatically
after a
specified time interval.<br>
Password lifetime and expiration, password history/complexity are also controlled via the <a href="profile_c.html">CREATE PROFILE</a> statement</p>
<p>The database uses password files to keep track of database usernames who have been granted the SYSDBA and SYSOPER privileges. These privileges allow DBAdmin
and DBOperator rights.</p>
<h2>The User Group PUBLIC</h2>
<p>  Each database contains a user group called PUBLIC. The PUBLIC user group provides public access to specific schema objects, such as tables and views, and provides
all users with specific system privileges. Every user automatically belongs to the PUBLIC user group.<br>
As members of PUBLIC, users can see (select from) all data dictionary tables prefixed with USER and ALL. Additionally, a user can grant a privilege or a
role to PUBLIC. All users can use the privileges granted to PUBLIC.<br>
<br>
You can grant or revoke any system privilege, object privilege, or role to PUBLIC.<br>
However, to maintain tight security over access rights, grant only privileges and roles that are of interest to all users to PUBLIC.<br>
<br>
Granting and revoking some system and object privileges to and from PUBLIC can cause every view, procedure, function, package, and trigger in the database
to be recompiled.<br>
<br>
PUBLIC has the following restrictions:<br>
You cannot assign tablespace quotas to PUBLIC, although you can assign the UNLIMITED TABLESPACE system privilege to PUBLIC.<br>
You can create database links and synonyms as PUBLIC (using CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK/SYNONYM), but no other schema object can be owned by PUBLIC.<br>
