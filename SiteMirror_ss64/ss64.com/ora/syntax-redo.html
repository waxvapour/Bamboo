<h2>Redo</h2>
<p>  In addition to <a href="syntax-storage.html">datafiles</a> for storing database data,
  every Oracle database has a set of (two or more) redo log files. <br>
  The redo log records all <i>changes</i> made to data, including both uncommitted and
committed changes.</p>
<p>To change data a session will generate some redo change vectors and record them in the redo log buffer.<br>
As it records the redo change vectors it applies the changes to the data blocks (including the undo blocks)</p>
<p>Changes are saved to redo by the log writer process:<br>
  <br>
  The redo log can consist of two parts: the online redo log and the archived
  redo log. <br>
  To avoid losing the database due to a single point of failure, Oracle
  can maintain multiple sets of online redo log files. </p>
<p>Assuming the database  operates in ARCHIVELOG mode, Oracle will create an
  archived
redo log at every checkpoint - these can be used to 
recover from a disk failure. <br>
<br>
Archived
redo logs should be backed up and deleted regularly.<br>
<br>
Online redo logs should <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/comp.databases.oracle.server/ScWw0wzCATk/_8rgfTgXjEoJ">not</a> be backed up.</p>
<p>The size of a redo log file
      directly influences checkpoint frequency and performance. Checkpoint frequency
  can vary widely according to system activity but two or three per hour is typical. To insure a reasonable frequency of log switches  set <span class="code"><a href="syntax-initora.html">ALTER SYSTEM SET</a> ARCHIVE_LAG_TARGET = 2400 SCOPE=BOTH;</span></p>
<h2>Rollback</h2>
<p>  Rolling back means undoing  changes to data that have been performed  within
an uncommitted SQL transaction. </p>
<p>If at any time an SQL statement causes an error, all effects of the statement
  are rolled back. <br>
  The user can also request a statement-level rollback by issuing a <a href="rollback.html">ROLLBACK</a>  statement.</p>
<p>Rollback segments  store the data as it was <i>before</i> changes were made. This
  is in contrast to the redo log which is a
record of the insert/update/deletes.</p>
<h2>Commit</h2>
<p>  After a commit, the log writer process (LGWR)  will write redo log entries from
  the SGA (Log
Buffer) into the online redo log file. </p>
<p>On the commit, your session posts a message to LGWR to write the log  buffer to disc up to the point that includes the last redo change vector  created by the session.<br>
The session waits for the log writer to confirm that it has written the log before continuing.</p>
<p>The Database Writer Process (DBWR) writes modified blocks from the database buffer cache to the data files. At no point does the commit FORCE the database writer to write the changed blocks to disc - a moment will come when DBWR just happens to wake up and decide that it&rsquo;s  time  they were written to disk.</p>
<p>If a user disconnects from Oracle the current transaction is committed.<br>
  Applications should always explicitly <a href="commit.html">commit</a> or <a href="rollback.html">rollback</a> transactions before
program termination.</p>
<h2>Storing Undo Records</h2>
<p>  Undo records
can be stored in either rollback segments or undo tablespaces.</p>
<p><i>Rollback Segment Undo </i><br>
  Rollback segments have traditionally stored undo information
  used by several functions of Oracle. During database recovery, after all changes
  recorded in the redo log have been applied, Oracle uses rollback segment information
  to undo any uncommitted transactions. Because rollback segments are stored
  in the database buffers, this important recovery information is automatically
  protected by the redo log. <a href="syntax-initora.html">UNDO_MANAGEMENT</a>=MANUAL</p>
<p><i>Automatic Undo </i><br>
  Automatic undo management
  enables
  a DBA to exert control over how long undo records are retained before being
  overwritten. Automatic undo management mode is more efficient, and less complex
  to implement and manage than rollback segment undo. <a href="syntax-initora.html">UNDO_MANAGEMENT</a>=AUTO</p>
<h2>Managing Undo</h2>
<p>The UNDO_POOL directive enables DBAs to control
  runaway transactions by grouping users into
  consumer groups, with each group assigned a maximum undo space limit. Whenever
  the total undo space consumed by a group exceeds the limit, its users are
  not allowed to make any further updates, until undo space is freed up by other
  members (after their transactions commit or abort). </p>
<p>In addition to space management, a DBA can specify
    an UNDO_RETENTION period to minimise occurences of the &quot;snapshot too old&quot;
    error. You can  set this at
    startup or with the ALTER SYSTEM statement.</p>
<p> e.g.
        set retention to 20 minutes (1200 seconds): <br>
      <span class="code"><a href="system_a.html">ALTER SYSTEM</a> SET <a href="syntax-initora.html">UNDO_RETENTION</a> =
      1200;</span></p>
<p>An important caveat with this is that Oracle will not reuse space (wrap the rollback segment back around over itself) while there is an active transaction. So if you run a one hour long transaction and have a 20 minute retention - then the  undo tablespace will still continue to grow for the whole hour.</p>
<p>If the undo space is less than the longest running transaction, you will get a 'failure to extend' error and the transaction will fail and 
roll back.</p>
<p>Even when the retention period has passed Oracle does not actively delete data from undo, it will simply be overwritten by the next transaction. </p>
<p>Typical values for an 
undo tablespace range from 1 GB to 20 GB. A 20%
    buffer
        of undo space is recommended to avoid excessive movement of space between
undo segments.</p>
<p>The default value of
    UNDO_POOL
    is UNLIMITED.<br>
  The default value of
   UNDO_RETENTION is a small 
value that should be adequate for most OLTP systems.</p>
<h2>Two-Phase Commit</h2>
<p>  In a distributed environment
  Oracle ensures data consistency using the transaction model and
  a two-phase commit mechanism. As in nondistributed
  systems, transactions should be carefully planned to include a logical
  set of SQL statements that should all succeed or fail as a unit. Oracle's two-phase
  commit mechanism guarantees that, a distributed transaction will either
  commit on all involved nodes or roll back on all involved nodes across
  the
  global distributed database.</p>
<h2>Flashback Query</h2>
<p>  Flashback Query, lets you view and repair historical data i.e perform queries
  on the database as of a certain wall clock time (or SCN)<br>
  This capability uses Oracle's multiversion read-consistency to restore data by
  applying undo as needed. Administrators can configure undo retention by specifying
  how long undo should be kept in the database.<br>
  <br>
  The speed of this operation depends only on the amount of data being queried
  and the number of changes to the data that need to be backed out.<br>
  You set the date and time you want to view. Then any SQL query you execute operates
  on data as it existed at that time. You can correct errors and back out the restored
  data.</p>
<p>Flashback Query does NOT undo anything. It is only a query mechanism. You
  can take the output from a flashback query and perform an Undo yourself in
  many circumstances.<br>
  - Flashback Query does NOT tell you what changed. LogMiner does that.<br>
  - Flashback Query can be used to undo changes and can be very efficient if
  you know the rows that need to be moved back in time. You can in theory use
  it to move a full table back in time but this is very expensive if the table
is large since it involves a full table copy.</p>
