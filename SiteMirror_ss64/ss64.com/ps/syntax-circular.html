<p>If an Active Directory(AD) group has another AD group as both it's parent and as a child member you have a circular nested reference.</p>
<p>Why would that matter?<br>
There is no technical reason preventing the use of circular references between AD groups, Active Directory can still calculate and grant access.
 The main reason that <a href="https://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/11856/whats-wrong-with-circular-references">circular references are considered harmful</a> is that they tend to make management more difficult.<br>
 In a well structured active directory every AD group will have a single purpose, ideally with people and resources in separate groups and  following a clear heirarchy.
If group A is a member of Group B and vice versa then neither group has a single purpose - both groups are now performing two tasks. Circular references are often the cause of unintended privilege escalation.</p>
<pre>
# Circular.ps1
# List all AD groups that contain one or more circular nested groups
# outputs the parent group's DN and a list of the nested groups.

# Limitations
# The script works by scanning through every group, so any circular relationships
# will be listed twice, once for the parent group and once for the child.

# ADSI has a limit of 1500 items for a multi-valued attribute so 
# groups containing more than 1500 members may return the error:
#  "Get-ADGroupMember : The size limit for this request was exceeded.."

# If a circular relationship exists between a large (>1500) group and small one,
# the script may fail enumerating the large group, but still detect the circular
# relationship against the small one.

# This script only checks direct members: A>B>A
# inherited circular memberships A>B>C>A will not be detected.
