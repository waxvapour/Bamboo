<p> Move the focus to a specific control on a form. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      <i>Object</i>.SetFocus

Key
   <i>Object</i>   The control to receive focus.
</pre>
<p>Use the SetFocus method when you want all user input to be directed at a specific object.</p>
<p>Reading some control  properties requires the control to have the focus. For example, a text box must have the focus before you can read its Text property.</p>
<p>Setting some control properties requires  the control to NOT have the focus. For example, you can&rsquo;t set a control&rsquo;s Visible or Enabled properties to False (0) when that control has the focus.</p>
<p>You can move the focus only to a visible control or form. A form and controls on a form aren&rsquo;t visible until the form's Load event has finished. Use the Repaint method before SetFocus to ensure the control is visible.</p>
<p>If a form contains no enabled controls, then SetFocus will set focus to the form itself.</p>
<p>If a form contains one or more enabled controls attempting to move the focus to the form, will set focus to the control on the form that last received  focus.</p>
<p>SetFocus is used when <a href="openform.html">opening multiple copies of the same Access form</a>.</p>
<p>To move the focus to a control on a subform, first move the focus to the subform control and then a second SetFocus for the control on the subform.</p>
<p>SetFocus is the preferred method for moving  focus, rather than DoCmd.GoToControl</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<pre>Me!txtSurname.SetFocus
