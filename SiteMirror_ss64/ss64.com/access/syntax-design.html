</ul></div><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h1>Database Design - 1st, 2nd and 3rd normal form</h1>
<p>In a relational database you can design separate tables and columns to hold sets of related data. </p>
<p>This is vaguely similar to a spreadsheet with multiple tabs holding different data but with three key extra benefits: </p>
<ol>
<li>You can strictly define the type of data to be stored in each place (Numbers/dates/text) </li>
<li>Dates and numbers can be restricted to sensible values - <span class="code">Date_of_Birth</span> must be in the past, <span class="code">Zip_code</span> must be 20 characters or less etc.</li>
<li> You can define exactly how the tables are linked (related) to one another.</li>
</ol>
<p>It has been shown; in a series of systematic field audits  and lab experiments; that around <b>88% </b>of all spreadsheets contain errors (<a href="http://panko.shidler.hawaii.edu/SSR/Mypapers/whatknow.htm">Raymond R. Panko</a>, University of Hawaiâ€™i, 1998, Revised 2008) <br>
Moving data into a structured relational database can prevent many of these errors.</p>
<h2>First Normal Form</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The &nbsp;First Normal Form states that <i>all column values must be atomic</i> (singular)<br>
So the value for one column (in a record) must contain a single value, not a list of items or a coded value that has more than one meaning </p>
<p>For example an <span class="code">order_type</span> of 'A' meaning <i>Overseas+ Airmail</i>, then <span class="code">order_type</span> of 'B' meaning <i>Overseas+ Ship by boat</i> would fail to meet First Normal Form. Changing to separate columns will fix this and allow for the case of Airmail within the same country.</p>
<p>First Normal Form also prohibits the <i>presence of repeating groups even if they are stored in composite columns</i>.<br>
This means that a table for sales <span class="code">Orders</span> containing the columns:<br>
<span class="code">Order_No, Staff_id, Item1_description, Item2Description, </span><span class="code">Item3Description</span><br>
would fail to meet First Normal Form, even though the descriptions are in separate columns.</p>
<p>Changing the design so that every item gets it's own row in the table means that we can have any number of items from 1 upwards, the table columns then become:<br>
<span class="code">Order_No, Item_no,   Staff_id, Description</span> <br>
with a primary key of <span class="code">Order_No + Item_no</span> (concatenated) this is a valid First Normal Form table.</p>
</blockquote><h2>Second Normal Form</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The &nbsp;Second Normal Form implies that a tableis in First Normal Form and <i>every non-key column is fully dependent on the entire primary key</i>. In plain language the table should contain data relating to one 'thing' and the primary key will uniquely identify each 'thing'.</p>
<p>In the example above the <span class="code">Staff_id</span> field is <b>not</b> <i>fully dependent on the entire primary key</i>, assuming only one member of staff would enter all the items in  each order, then if you know the <span class="code">Order_No</span> you will know the <span class="code">Staff_id</span> without having to know the <span class="code">Item_no</span></p>
<p>This typically means that some   data items need to be split into a separate table, in this case an <span class="code">Order_items</span> table which  would link back to the main <span class="code">Orders</span> table.</p>
<p>Orders table:<br>
<span class="code">Order_No,    Staff_id</span></p>
<p>Order_Items table:<br>
<span class="code">Order_No, Item_no,   Quantity, Description</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Third Normal Form</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To meet the requirements of&nbsp;Third Normal Form a table must meet the requirements of Second normal form plus <i>all non-key columns are mutually independent</i>. </p>
<p>Orders table:<br>
<span class="code">Order_No,    Staff_id</span></p>
<p>Order_Items table:<br>
<span class="code">Order_No, Item_no,   Description</span></p>
