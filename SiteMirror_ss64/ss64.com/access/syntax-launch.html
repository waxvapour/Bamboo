<p>A best practice in designing any Access database is to split the database into a front-end containing Access forms and code and a back-end containing just tables and indexes, either as an Access MDB or ACCDB or preferrably a SQL Server database.</p>
<p>Even with this setup you can still run into corruption problems when the front-end is shared between multiple users. Access has a built in utility - <i>Compact and Repair </i>which will clean up temporary objects, cached query results etc. When allowed to run once a day this will typically keep the system running well. However as soon as multiple users are involved it is likely that one or more users will leave the database open for days on end. That means <i>Compact and Repair </i>will never run and eventually you will end up with corruption.</p>
<p>One way to avoid this problem is to use a startup launcher, commercial packages are available (listed below) but a simple batch file can be used - give each user a shortcut to the launcher script, this in turn makes a copy of the front end for each user and then opens the database. When that user closes their copy of the database <i>Compact and Repair </i>will be able to run.</p>
<p>This technique can also be used to deliver new versions of the database, incrementing the version number will cause a fresh copy to be made the next time each user opens the launcher.</p>
<p>On a modern network this will add a small startup delay of a second or two, but only for the first run, normal use thereafter should have no noticable startup delay.</p>
