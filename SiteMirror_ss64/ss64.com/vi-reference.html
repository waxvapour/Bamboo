<h2><a id="delete">Deleting text</a></h2>
<p> Everything deleted can be stored into a buffer. This is achieved
by putting a<span class="code"> "</span> and a letter <span class="code">&lt;a-z&gt;</span> before the delete command. The
deleted text will be in the buffer with the used letter. If <span class="code">&lt;A-Z&gt;</span> is
used as buffer name, the conjugate buffer <span class="code">&lt;a-z&gt;</span> will be augmented
(i.e., appended) instead of overwritten with the text. The undo
buffer always contains the latest change. Buffers <span class="code">&lt;1-9&gt;</span> contain
the latest 9 LINE deletions ("1 is most recent).  See also

<h2><a id="substitute">Substitute replacement patterns</a>

<p><br>
The basic meta-characters for the replacement pattern are <span class="code">&amp; </span>and<span class="code"> ~ </span>; these are given as `<span class="code">\&amp;</span>' and `<span class="code">\~</span>' when <span class="code">nomagic</span> is set.<br>
Each instance of <span class="code">&amp;</span> is replaced by the characters which the
regular expression matched. </p>
<p>The meta-character<span class="code"> ~ </span>stands, in
the replacement pattern, for the defining text of the previous
replacement pattern.  Other meta-sequences possible in the
replacement pattern are always introduced by the escaping character<span class="code"> \ </span>The sequence <span class="code">\n</span> (with <span class="code">n</span> in <span class="code">[1-9]</span>) is replaced by the text
matched by the n-th regular subexpression enclosed between<span class="code"> \( </span>and<span class="code"> \) </span>. The sequences<span class="code"> \u </span>and<span class="code"> \l </span>cause the immediately following
character in the replacement to be converted to upper- or lower-case
respectively if this character is a letter.  The sequences<span class="code"> \U </span>and<span class="code"> \L </span>turn such conversion on, either until<span class="code"> \E </span>or<span class="code"> \e </span>is
encountered, or until the end of the replacement pattern.  See the <a href="#important">magic</a> option for additional meta-characters.  Some examples of
substitutions are shown below.<br>

    :map &lt;string&gt; &lt;seq&gt;     | &lt;string&gt; is interpreted as &lt;seq&gt;, e.g.
                            |   `:map ^C :!cc %^V&lt;cr&gt;' to invoke `cc' (the C
                            |   compiler) from within the editor
                            |   (vi replaces `%' with the current file name).
                            |
    :map                    | Show all mappings.
                            |
    :unmap &lt;string&gt;         | Deprive &lt;string&gt; of its mapping.  When vi
                            |   complains about non-mapped macros (whereas no
                            |   typos have been made), first do something like
                            |   `:map &lt;string&gt; Z', followed by
                            |   `:unmap &lt;string&gt;' (`Z' must not be a macro
                            |   itself), or switch to `ex' mode first with `Q'.
                            |
    :map! &lt;string&gt; &lt;seq&gt;    | Mapping in append mode, e.g.

                            |   When in append mode &lt;string&gt; is preceded by
                            |   `^V', no mapping is done.

                            |   followed by a breakpoint (e.g. &lt;sp&gt; or `,'), it
                            |   is interpreted as &lt;seq&gt;, e.g.
                            |   `:ab ^P procedure'.  A `^V' immediately
                            |   following &lt;string&gt; inhibits expansion.

                            |   the first file.

    The editor can be initialized by the shell variable `EXINIT', which
    looks like:

            EXINIT='&lt;cmd&gt;|&lt;cmd&gt;|...'
            &lt;cmd&gt;: set options
                   map ...
                   ab ...
            export EXINIT (in the Bourne shell)

    However, the list of initializations can also be put into a file.
    If this file is located in your home directory, and is named `.exrc'
    AND the variable `EXINIT' is NOT set, the list will be executed
    automatically at startup time. However, vi will always execute the
    contents of a `.exrc' in the current directory, if you own the file.
    Else you have to give the execute (`source') command yourself:

            :so file

    In a `.exrc' file a comment is introduced with a double quote character:
    the rest of the line is ignored.  Exception: if the last command on the
    line is a `map[!]' or `ab' command or a shell escape, a trailing comment
    is not recognized, but considered part of the command.

    On-line initializations can be given with `vi +&lt;cmd&gt; file', e.g.:

    vi +x file              | The cursor will immediately jump to line x
                            |   (default last line).
                            |
    vi +/&lt;string&gt; file      | Jump to the first occurrence of &lt;string&gt;.

    You can start at a particular tag with:

    vi -t &lt;tag&gt;             | Start in the right file in the right place.

    Sometimes (e.g. if the system crashed while you were editing) it is
    possible to recover files lost in the editor by `vi -r file'.  A plain
    `vi -r' command shows the files you can recover.
    If you just want to view a file by using vi, and you want to avoid any
    change, instead of vi you can use the `view' or `vi -R' command:
    the option `readonly' will be set automatically (with `:w!' you can
    override this option).

                            |   CHAR on the previous line.  However, if the

                            |   preceded by a `\'.  If the option is turned off
                            |   it's just the other way around.  Meta-chars:

                            |     &lt;sp&gt;vi:set options|map ...|ab ...|!...:
                            |
                            |   Instead of &lt;sp&gt; a &lt;ht&gt; can be used, instead of
                            |   `vi' there can be `ex'.  Warning: this option
                            |   could have nasty results if you edit a file
                            |   containing `strange' modelines.
                            |

                            |   indicates the previous char is a single letter
                            |   macro.  `:set para=P\ bp' introduces `.P' and
                            |   `.bp' as paragraph delimiters.  Empty lines and
                            |   section boundaries are paragraph boundaries
                            |   too.

                            |   expanded until they are unchanged.
                            |   Example: if `o' is mapped to `A', and `A'
                            |   is mapped to `I', then `o' will map to `I'
                            |   if `remap' is set, else it will map to `A'.
                            |
    report=&lt;*&gt;              | Vi reports whenever e.g. a delete
                            |   or yank command affects &lt;*&gt; or more lines.

                            |   and `]]'); see option `para'. A `{' beginning a
                            |   line also starts a section (as in C functions).
                            |
    sh=&lt;string&gt;             | shell - The program to be used for shell escapes
                            |   (default `$SHELL' (default `/bin/sh')).

    sw=&lt;*&gt;                  | shiftwidth - Gives the shiftwidth (default 8

                            |   `{' and `}'.  If there's no match at all, vi
                            |   will beep.

    taglength=&lt;*&gt;           | The number of significant characters in tags
                            |   (0 = unlimited).

                            |
    ts=&lt;*&gt;                  | tabstop - The length of a &lt;ht&gt;; warning: this is
                            |   only IN the editor, outside of it &lt;ht&gt;s have

    wa                      | writeany - No checks when writing (dangerous).

                            |   (0 = don't put a &lt;lf&gt; in the file, yet put it
                            |   on the screen).
