<p>Manage Boot Configuration Data (BCD) data stores.
<pre>Syntax
      BCDEdit /Command [<i>Argument1</i>] [<i>Argument2</i>] ...

Key
      /? <i>commmand</i>   To display detailed help for a particular command, run bcdedit /?command,
                    where <i>command </i>is the name of the command you are searching for more information about.
                    e.g. bcdedit /? createstore

   Store commands:

      /createstore  Creates a new empty boot configuration data store.
                    The created store is not a system store.

      /export       Export the contents of the system store into a file.
                    This file can be used later to restore the state of the system store.
                    Valid only for the system store.

      /import       Restore the state of the system store by using a backup data file
                    previously generated with /export.
                    This command deletes any existing entries in the system store before
                    the import takes place. Valid only for the system store.

      /store        This option can be used with most BCDedit commands to specify
                    the store to be used. If this option is not specified, then
                    BCDEdit operates on the system store.
                    Running the bcdedit /store command by itself is equivalent to running
                    the bcdedit /enum active command.

      /sysstore     Set the system store device. This only affects EFI-based systems.
                    It does not persist across reboots, and is only used in cases where the system
                    store device is ambiguous.

   Operating on entries in a store:

      /copy         Make a copy of a specified boot entry in the same system store.

      /create       Create a new entry in the boot configuration data store.
                    If a well-known identifier is specified, then the /application, /inherit, and
                    /device options cannot be specified. If an identifier is not specified or not well
                    known, an /application, /inherit, or /device option must be specified. 

      /delete       Delete an element from a specified entry.

      /mirror       Create a mirror of entries in the store.

   Changing entry options:

      /deletevalue  Delete a specified element from a boot entry.

      /set          Set an entry option value.

   Controlling output:

      /enum         List entries in a store. The /enum option is the default value for BCEdit, so running
                    the bcdedit command without options is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active command.

      /v            Verbose mode.
                    Usually, any well-known entry identifiers are represented by their friendly shorthand form.
                    Specifying /v as a command-line option displays all identifiers in full.
                    Running the bcdedit /v command by itself is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active /v command.

   Controlling the boot manager:

      /bootsequence Specifies a one-time display order to be used for the next boot.
                    This command is similar to the /displayorder option, except that it is used only the
                    next time the computer starts. Afterwards, the computer reverts to the original
                    display order.
      /default      Specifies the default entry that the boot manager selects when the timeout expires.

      /displayorder Specifies the display order that the boot manager uses when displaying boot options
                    to a user.
      /timeout      Specifies the time to wait, in seconds, before the boot manager selects the default entry.

      /toolsdisplayorder  Specifies the display order for the boot manager to use when displaying the Tools menu.

   Emergency Management Services options:

      /bootems      Enable or disable Emergency Management Services (EMS) for the specified entry.

      /ems          Enable or disable EMS for the specified operating system boot entry.

      /emssettings  Set the global EMS settings for the computer.
                    /emssettings does not enable or disable EMS for any particular boot entry.

   Debugging:

      /bootdebug    Enable or disable the boot debugger for a specified boot entry.
                    Although this command works for any boot entry, it is effective only for boot applications.

      /dbgsettings  Specifies or displays the global debugger settings for the system.
                    This command does not enable or disable the kernel debugger; use the /debug option for
                    that purpose. To set an individual global debugger setting, use the
                    bcdedit /setdbgsettings type value command.

      /debug        Enable or disable the kernel debugger for a specified boot entry.

      /hypervisorsettings  Set the hypervisor parameters.</pre>
<p>BCDEdit is a command-line tool for managing Boot Configuration Data (BCD). BCD files provide a store that is used to describe boot applications and boot application settings.</p>
<p>A normal shutdown and reboot is necessary to ensure that any modified BCDEdit settings are flushed to disk. </p>
<p>BCDEdit is included in the <span class="code">%WINDIR%\System32</span> folder. <br>
BCDEdit is limited to the standard data types and is designed primarily to perform single common changes to BCD. </p>
<p>Some common BCD operations, such as recovering a partition or setting up a new PC's system partition, may be more easily accomplished by using <a href="bcdboot.html">BCDBOOT</a>.</p>
<p>Administrative privileges are required to use BCDEdit to modify Boot Configuration Data.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>This command will enable the system to trust Windows Insider Preview builds that are signed with certificates that are not trusted by default: </p>
<p class="code">Bcdedit /set {bootmgr} flightsigning on <br>
Bcdedit /set flightsigning on </p>
<p>Reboot after running the command. <br>
<br>
To turn off flightsigning: </p>
<p class="code">Bcdedit /set {bootmgr} flightsigning off<br>
Bcdedit /set flightsigning off</p>
