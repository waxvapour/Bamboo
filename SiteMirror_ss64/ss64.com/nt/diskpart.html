 RETAIN   (Prepare an existing dynamic simple volume to be used as a boot or system volume)</pre>
<p>When setting up a new drive, create in this order: Create Partition, Format drive, Assign drive letter.</p>
<p>The diskpart commands can be placed in a text file (one command per line) and
used  as an input file to diskpart.exe:</p>
<pre>DiskPart.exe &lt; myscript.txt
</pre>
<p>When selecting a volume or partition, you can use either the number or drive letter or the mount point path.</p>
<p>The Windows GUI interface can also be used to assign a mount-point folder path to a drive. In <span class="code">Disk Manager</span>, right-click the partition or volume, and  click <span class="code">Change Drive Letter and Paths</span>,     then click <span class="code">Add</span> and then type the path to an empty folder on an NTFS volume.</p>
<p>The Windows <a href="syntax-recovery.html">Recovery Console</a>, includes a simplified DISKPART command. It only provides functionality for adding and deleting partitions, but not for setting an active partition.</p>
<p>Always  back up the hard disk before running diskpart.</p>
<p> Examples:<br>
</p>
<pre>
SELECT DISK=0
CREATE PARTITION PRIMARY
SELECT PARTITION=1
FORMAT FS=NTFS LABEL="New Volume" QUICK<br>ASSIGN LETTER=E
EXIT </pre>
<p>The default SAN policy in Windows Server 2008 / R2 is now VDS_SP_OFFLINE_SHARED for all non boot SAN disks.<br>
This  means that the disks will be offline at server startup (even if the drive contains a paging file).</p>
<p>This Disk Management error message indicates that the drive is offline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="code">&quot;the disk is offline because of policy set by an administrator&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Query the current SAN policy to see if it is Offline Shared</p>
<p class="code">DISKPART.EXE <br>
DISKPART&gt; san <br>
SAN Policy : Offline Shared</p>
<p>To manually bring the disks online: <br>
<span class="code">Computer Management &gt; Storage &gt; Disk Management</span>, right-click the disk and choose <span class="code">Online</span>.</p>
<p>If these are <b>not</b> part of a cluster, than an alternative is to make a SAN policy change,  select the offline disk, clear  its readonly flag and bring it online:</p>
<pre> DISKPART&gt; san policy=OnlineAll 
 DiskPart successfully changed the SAN policy for the current operating system.
