<h1>Double %% symbols why are they needed in a batch file?</h1>
<p>A common question asked by new batch file programmers is &quot;<i>why do we need to double the percent symbols when writing a FOR command?</i>&quot;. On the command line <span class="code">%A</span> works fine, so why does a batch need <span class="code">%%A</span>? </p>
<p>To answer this we need to consider all the  things in the batch language which use the % symbol:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly <a href="syntax-args.html">command line parameters</a> <span class="code">%0 %1 %2 %3 ...</span><br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Next the <a href="for.html">FOR</a> command, while most people will sensibly choose parameter letters like  <span class="code">%A</span> or <span class="code">%F</span> or <span class="code">%Z</span>, it is perfectly possible to choose numbers <span class="code">%1 %2 %3 ...</span><br>
<br>
Try this at the command line: <br>
<span class="code"><br>
FOR /L %6 in (1,1,5) Do Echo %6 </span><br>
<br>
It will work and give you a nice list of numbers from 1 to 5.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you see the problem this presents, you can have  two different types of variablewith identical names and  the CMD command shell parser needs a way to separate them.</p>
<h2>How the CMD shell command line parser evaluates variables:</h2>
<p>The CMD shell reads through each line of a batch file once from left to right, when it finds a percent sign it checks the next character and proceeds as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> If the next character is  another percent sign (<span class="code">%</span>), CMD replaces the two with a single percent sign and then reads the third character evaluating it either as a FOR parameter or, if not in a <a href="for.html">FOR</a> loop, just treating it as the plain character '%'.<br>
<span class="code">%%G =&gt; 
somevalue<br>
%%Hello =&gt; %Hello<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>If the next character is a digit (<span class="code">0-9</span>) CMD replaces the percent sign and digit with the value of the corresponding command line <a href="syntax-args.html">parameter</a>. Also if the character is a tilde (<span class="code">~</span>) then <a href="syntax-args.html">Parameter Extensions</a> will be applied.<br>
<span class="code">%1 =&gt; somevalue</span><br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>  If the next character is anything else (so not a number or a % symbol) CMD treats everything up to the next percent sign as the name of a <a href="syntax-variables.html">variable</a> and replaces it with the value of that variable.<br>
<span class="code">%_somevariable% </span><span class="code">=&gt; somevalue</span></li>
</ul>
<p>When working at the command line (not in a batch script) there is no possibility of any batch file parameters %1, %2 etc so the logic above is not followed and hence FOR parameters on the command line only need a single %.</p>
<p>One other place where a percent character is used is as the modulus operator in the <a href="set.html">SET /A</a> command,  in a batch file this should always be passed as a pair of double %%'s.</p>
<p>It is worth also considering how this affects normal variables -  this does not make for readable code, but just to prove a point, lets try to create a standard variable with a variable name that is purely numeric:<br>
<br>
<span class="code">SET 1=Hello</span></p>
<p>You might expect that to  create the variable <span class="code">%1%</span>, but in a batch file it will Fail.</p>
<p>Even if the script was called without passing any parameter %1, the parameters  take precedence, so <span class="code">%1%</span> is evaluated as <span class="code">%1</span> plus an extra <span class="code">%</span> at the end.
Remember the command line is parsed left to right only once, so the %1 is evaluated before the second % is even read.
<br>
You can of course do this at the command line and it will work!</p>
<p>So what have we learned from all this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never try to start a variable name with a number, a common practice is to prefix all variables with an _underscore, if you make a habit of that you will never be bitten by the invalid numeric name issue.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Don't use numbers as FOR parameter variables, it may work but it will confuse people (and is undocumented).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you want to use a plain % symbol <i>anywhere</i> in a batch file, you need to double the %'s<br>
<br>
<span class="code">Echo &quot;This includes a 50%% discount&quot;<br>
&gt; This includes a 50% discount<br>
<br>
</span>This includes references to filenames, the % is a legal character for a filename, but to access it from a batch file you need to double it:<br>
<br>
<span class="code">Start &quot;C:\my work\Demo %% calc.xlsx&quot; </span><br>
Will open the file 
<span class="code">Demo % calc.xlsx</span><br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you are aghast at the insanity of all these arcane rules, you should be learning <a href="../ps/index.html">PowerShell</a>, it's awesome!</li>
</ul>
