<p> DevCon is not redistributable. It is provided for use as a debugging and development tool. <b><br>
<br>
Examples:</b></p>
<p>List all known PCI devices on the computer pc64.</p>
<p class="code">devcon -m:\\pc64 find pci\*</p>
<p>Install a new instance of the Microsoft loopback adaptor and  restart if required. This creates a new root-enumerated device node with which you can install a &quot;virtual device,&quot; such as the loopback adaptor. </p>
<p class="code">devcon -r install %WINDIR%\Inf\Netloop.inf *MSLOOP</p>
<p>List all known setup classes. Displays both the short  name and the descriptive name.</p>
<p class="code">devcon classes</p>
<p>Lists files that are associated with each device in the ports setup class.</p>
<p class="code">devcon driverfiles =ports</p>
<p>Disable all devices that have a hardware ID that ends in &quot;MSLOOP&quot; (including &quot;*MSLOOP&quot;).</p>
<p class="code">devcon disable *MSLOOP</p>
<p>List all compatible drivers for the device ROOT\PCI_HAL\PNP0A03. This can be used to determine why an integral device information (.inf) file was chosen, instead of a third-party .inf file.</p>
<p class="code">devcon drivernodes @ROOT\PCI_HAL\PNP0A03</p>
<p>Enable all devices that have a hardware ID of &quot;*MSLOOP&quot;. The single quotation mark indicates that the hardware ID must be taken literally (in other words, the asterisk [&quot;*&quot;] actually is an asterisk; it is not a wildcard character).</p>
<p class="code">devcon enable '*MSLOOP</p>
<p>List device instances of all devices that are present on the local computer.</p>
<p class="code">devcon find *</p>
<p>List all known peripheral component interconnect (PCI) devices that are on the local computer (this command assumes that a device is PCI if it has a hardware ID that is prefixed by &quot;PCI\&quot;).</p>
<p class="code">devcon find pci\*</p>
<p>List devices that are a member of the ports setup class and that contain &quot;PNP&quot; in their hardware ID.</p>
<p class="code">devcon find =ports *pnp*</p>
<p>List devices that are present that are a member of the ports setup class and that are in the &quot;root&quot; branch of the enum tree (the instance ID is prefixed by &quot;root\&quot;). Note that you should not make any programmatic assumption about how an instance ID is formatted. To determine root devices, you can look at device status bits. This feature is included in DevCon to aid in debugging.</p>
<p class="code">devcon find =ports @root\*</p>
<p>List &quot;nonpresent&quot; devices and devices that are present for the ports class. This includes devices that have been removed, devices that have been moved from one slot to another and, in some cases, devices that have been enumerated differently due to a BIOS change.</p>
<p class="code">devcon findall =ports</p>
<p>List all devices that are present for each class named (in this case, USB and 1394).</p>
<p class="code">devcon listclass usb 1394</p>
<p>Remove all USB devices. Devices that are removed are listed with their removal status.</p>
<p class="code">devcon remove @usb\*</p>
<p>Rescan for new Plug and Play devices.</p>
<p class="code">devcon rescan</p>
<p>List the resources that are used by all devices in the ports setup class.</p>
<p class="code">devcon resources =ports</p>
<p>Restart the loopback adaptor ROOT\*MSLOOP\0000. The single quotation mark in the command indicates that the instance ID must be taken literally.</p>
<p class="code">devcon restart =net @'ROOT\*MSLOOP\0000</p>
<p>List all hardware IDs of mouse class devices on the system.</p>
<p class="code">devcon hwids=mouse</p>
<p>Assign the hardware ID, beep, to the legacy beep device.</p>
<p class="code">devcon sethwid @ROOT\LEGACY_BEEP\0000 := beep</p>
<p>List the status of each device present that has an instance ID that begins with &quot;pci\&quot;.</p>
<p class="code">devcon status @pci\*</p>
<p>List the status of an Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)-enumerated serial port.</p>
<p class="code">devcon status @ACPI\PNP0501\1</p>
<p>List the status of all COM ports. </p>
<p class="code">devcon status *PNP05* </p>
<p><b>Errorlevels</b> returned by DevCon.exe:<br>
0 = success.<br>
1 - restart is required.<br>
2 = failure.<br>
3 = syntax error. <br>
