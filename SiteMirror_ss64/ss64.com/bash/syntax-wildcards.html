<p>Wildcards allow pattern matching within both Regular Expressions and in Globbing<code></code>.</p>
<p>Bash performs filename expansion on <b>unquoted</b> command-line arguments.</p>
<p>Any command that uses quotes e.g.<span class="code"> echo &quot;hello&quot; </span>or<span class="code"> echo '*' </span>will simply echo the text.<br>
Without quotes <span class="code">echo * </span>will perform globbing and echo a list of files in the current directory.</p>

<p>Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern characters described below, matches itself. <br>
The NUL character can not occur in a pattern. The special pattern characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally. </p>
<p>The special pattern characters have the following meanings: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>*</code> Matches any string, including the null string.  </p>
<p><code>?</code> Matches any single character. </p>
<p><code>[...] </code>Matches any one of the enclosed characters. </p>
<p><span class="code">A-C </span>A pair of characters separated by a minus sign denotes a <i>range</i>; any character lexically between those two characters, inclusive, is matched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> To prevent any file named with dashes (<span class="code">-rf</span>) being interpreted as a commnd option, it is a good idea to use <span class="code">/some/path/*</span> (or <span class="code">./*</span> for the current directory) rather than just a bare <span class="code">*</span></p>
<p>If the first character following the <samp>`['</samp> is a <samp>`!'</samp> or a <samp>`^'</samp> then any character not enclosed is matched. A <samp>`-'</samp> can be matched by including it as the first or last character in the set. A <samp>`]'</samp> can be matched by including it as the first character in the set. Within <samp>`['</samp> 
  and <samp>`]'</samp>, <i>character classes</i> can be specified using the syntax <code>[:</code><i>class</i><code>:]</code>, where <i>class</i> is one of the following classes defined in the POSIX 1003.2 standard:</p>
<pre>alnum   alpha   ascii   blank   cntrl   digit   graph   lower
print   punct   space   upper   xdigit</pre>
<p> A character class matches any character belonging to that class. Within <samp>`['</samp> and <samp>`]'</samp>, an <i>equivalence class</i> can be specified using the syntax <code>[=</code><i>c</i><code>=]</code>, which matches all characters with the same collation weight (as defined by the current locale) as the character <i>c</i>. Within <samp>`['</samp> and <samp>`]'</samp>, the syntax <code>[.</code><i>symbol</i><code>.]</code> matches the collating symbol <i>symbol</i>. 
</p>
<p>If the <code>extglob</code> shell option is enabled using the <code>shopt</code> builtin, several extended pattern matching operators are recognized. In the following description, a <i>pattern-list</i> is a list of one or more patterns separated by a <samp>`|'</samp>. Composite patterns can be formed using one or more of the following sub-patterns: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>?(<i>pattern-list</i>)</code> Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns. 
<br>
<br><code>*(<i>pattern-list</i>)</code> Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns. 
<br>
<br><code>+(<i>pattern-list</i>)</code> Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns. 
<br>
<br><code>@(<i>pattern-list</i>)</code> Matches exactly one of the given patterns. 
<br>
<br><code>!(<i>pattern-list</i>)</code> Matches anything except one of the given patterns.</p>
