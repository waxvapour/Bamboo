<p>Display the differences between two files, or each corresponding 
  file in two directories. <br>
  Each set of differences is called a "diff" or "patch". For files that are identical, 
  diff normally produces no output; for binary (non-text) files, diff normally 
reports only that they are different.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      diff [<i>options</i>] <i>FILES</i></pre>
<pre>Options</pre><p>Multiple single letter options (unless they take an argument) can be combined into a single command line word: so `-ac' is equivalent to `-a -c'.</p> 
<pre>   FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE... DIR'.
              If --from-file or --to-file is given, there are no restrictions on FILES.

   LETTERs are as follows for new group, lower case for old group:
   F       first line number 
   L       last line number 
   N       number of lines = L-F+1 
   E       F-1 
   M       L+1

   LFMT can contain:
   %L       contents of line 
   %l       contents of line, excluding any trailing newline 
   %[-][WIDTH][.[PREC]]{doxX}n
            <a href="printf.html">printf</a>-style spec for input line number

   Either GFMT or LFMT can contain:
   %%        % 
   %c'C'     The single character C 
   %c'\OOO'  The character with octal code OOO </pre>
<p>In the simplest case, diff compares the contents of the two files <i>from-file</i>and <i>to-file</i>. A file name of - stands for text read from the standard input. </p>
<p>If <i>from-file</i> is a directory and <i>to-file </i>is not, diff compares the file in <i>from-file</i> whose file name is that of <i>to-file</i>, and vice versa. The non-directory file must not be -. </p>
<p>If both <i>from-file</i> and <i>to-file </i>are directories, diff compares corresponding files in both directories, in alphabetical order; this comparison is not recursive unless the -r or --recursive option is given. </p>
<p>GNU `diff' can show whether files are different without detailing the differences.<br>
It also provides ways to suppress certain kinds of differences that are not important to you. <br><br>
Most commonly, such differences are changes in the amount of white space between words or lines. `diff' also provides ways to suppress differences in alphabetic case or in lines that match a regular expression that you provide. <br>
<br>These options can accumulate; for example, you can ignore changes in both white space and alphabetic case.<b><br><br>
End -of-Line markers</b><br>
In operating systems that distinguish between text and binary files, `diff' normally reads and writes all data as text. <br><br>
Use the `--binary' option to force `diff' to read and write binary data instead. This option has no effect on a Posix-compliant system like GNU or traditional Unix. However, many personal computer operating systems represent the end of 
a line with a carriage return followed by a newline. <br><br>
On such systems, `diff' normally ignores these carriage returns on input and generates them at the end of each output line, but with the `--binary' option `diff' treats each carriage return as just another input character, and does 
not generate a carriage return at the end of each output line. <br><br>
This can be useful when dealing with non-text files that are meant to be interchanged with Posix-compliant systems.<br><br>
<b>Ignore Case</b></p>
<p>GNU `diff' can treat lowercase letters as equivalent to their uppercase counterparts, so that, for example, it considers `Funky Stuff', `funky STUFF', and `fUNKy 
stuFf' to all be the same. <br>To request this, use the `-i' or `--ignore-case' option.<br><br>
<b>Suppressing Lines Matching a Regular Expression</b><br>
To ignore insertions and deletions of lines that match a regular expression, use the `-I REGEXP' or `--ignore-matching-lines=REGEXP' option. <br>
You should escape regular expressions that contain shell metacharacters to prevent the shell from expanding them. <br><br>
For example, <span class="code">diff -I '^[0-9]'</span> ignores all changes to lines beginning with a digit. <br><br>
However, <span class="code">-I</span> only ignores the insertion or deletion of lines that contain the regular expression if every changed line in the hunk--every insertion and every 
deletion--matches the regular expression. <br><br>
In other words, for each non-ignorable change, `diff' prints the complete set of changes in its vicinity, including the ignorable ones. You can specify more than one regular expression for lines to ignore by using more than one `-I' option. `diff' tries to match each line against each regular expression, starting with the last one given.<br>
<br><b>Summarizing Which Files Differ</b><br>
When you only want to find out whether files are different, and you don't care what the differences are, you can use the summary output format. <br>
In this format, instead of showing the differences between the files, `diff' simply reports whether files differ. <br>
The `-q' and `--brief' options select this output format. <br>This format is especially useful when comparing the contents of two directories. It is also much faster than doing the normal line by line comparisons, because 
`diff' can stop analyzing the files as soon as it knows that there are any differences. <br>
You can also get a brief indication of whether two files differ by using `cmp'. <br><br>
<b>Using diff to patch a file</b><br>
To show context around the differing lines GNU `diff' provides these output formats <br>
<br>
Normal Format: An output format that shows each hunk of differences without any surrounding context<br>
Context Format:: An output format that shows surrounding lines. <br>
Unified Format:: A more compact output format that shows context.<br>
<br>
`patch' can apply diffs by searching in the files for the lines of context around the differing lines; if those lines are actually a few lines away from where the diff says they are, `patch' can adjust the line numbers accordingly and 
still apply the diff correctly.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p><span class="code">$ diff -q &lt;(sort file1.txt | uniq) &lt;(sort file2.txt | uniq)</span><br><br>
The command above will return 0 if <span class="code">file1.txt = file2.txt </span>and will return 1 if <span class="code">file1.txt &ne; file2.txt</span><br>Note the files have to be sorted first (the order matters) and if the files could contain duplicate values, then the output of sort has to be run through the uniq command to eliminate any duplicate elements. </p>
