<p>mount a file system<span class="body"><br>
  All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file 
  hierarchy, rooted at /. These files can be spread out over several devices. 
  The mount command serves to attach the file system found on some device to the 
  big file tree.</span><br>
  The system maintains a list of currently mounted file systems. If no arguments 
are given to mount, this list is printed. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      mount [-adfruvw] [-t <i>ufs</i> | <i>lfs</i> | <i>external_type</i>]

      mount [-dfruvw] special | node

      mount [-dfruvw] [-o <i>options</i>] [-t <i>ufs</i> | <i>lfs</i> | <i>external_type</i>] special node

Options
   <b>-a</b>  All the filesystems described in <b>fstab(5)</b> are mounted.  Excep-
  tions are those marked as ``noauto'' or are excluded by the <b>-t</b>
        flag (see below).
     

  <b>-d</b>  Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call.
  This option is useful in conjunction with the <b>-v</b> flag to deter-
  mine what the <b>mount</b> command is trying to do.

  <b>-f</b>  Forces the revocation of write access when trying to downgrade a
  filesystem mount status from read-write to read-only.

  <b>-o</b>  Options are specified with a <b>-o</b> flag followed by a comma sepa-
  rated string of options.  The following options are available:

       async   All I/O to the file system should be done asynchronously.
         This can be somewhat dangerous with respect to losing
         data when faced with system crashes and power outages.
         This is also the default.  It can be avoided with the
         <i>noasync</i> option.

       force   The same as <b>-f</b>; forces the revocation of write access
         when trying to downgrade a filesystem mount status from
         read-write to read-only.

       noasync
         This filesystem should not force all I/O to be written
         asynchronously.

       noauto  This filesystem should be skipped when mount is run with
         the <b>-a</b> flag.

       nodev   Do not interpret character or block special devices on
         the file system.  This option is useful for a server that
         has file systems containing special devices for architec-
         tures other than its own.

       noexec  Do not allow execution of any binaries on the mounted
         file system.  This option is useful for a server that has
         file systems containing binaries for architectures other
         than its own.

       nosuid  Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
         bits to take effect.

       rdonly  The same as <b>-r</b>; mount the file system read-only (even the
         super-user can not write it).

       sync    All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.

       update  The same as <b>-u</b>; indicate that the status of an already
         mounted file system should be changed.

       union   Causes the namespace at the mount point to appear as the
         union of the mounted filesystem root and the existing
         directory.   Lookups will be done in the mounted filesys-
         tem first.   If those operations fail due to a non-exis-
         tent file the underlying directory is then accessed.  All
         creates are done in the mounted filesystem.

       Any additional options specific to a filesystem type that is not
       one of the internally known types (see the <b>-t</b> option) can be
       passed as a comma separated list; these options are distinguished
       by a leading ``-'' (dash).   Options that take a value are speci-
       fied using the syntax -option=value.  For example, the mount com-
       mand:
       mount -t hfs -o nosuid,-w,-m=755 /dev/disk2s9 /tmp

       causes <b>mount</b> to execute the equivalent of:

       /sbin/mount_hfs -o nosuid -w -m 755 /dev/disk2s9 /tmp

  <b>-r</b>  The file system is to be mounted read-only.  Mount the file sys-
  tem read-only (even the super-user can not write it).  The same
  as the ``rdonly'' argument to the <b>-o</b> option.

  <b>-t</b> <i>ufs</i> | <i>lfs</i> | <i>external</i> <i>type</i>

  The argument following the <b>-t</b> is used to indicate the file system
  type.  The type <i>ufs</i> is the default.  The <i>-t</i> option can be used to
  indicate that the actions should only be taken on filesystems of
  the specified type.  More than one type can be specified in a
  comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be pre-
  fixed with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types for which
  action should <i>not</i> be taken.  For example, the <b>mount</b> command:

     mount -a -t nonfs,hfs

  mounts all filesystems except those of type NFS and HFS.

  If the type is not one of the internally known types, mount will
  attempt to execute a program in <i>/sbin/mount</i><b>_</b><i>XXX</i> where <i>XXX</i> is
  replaced by the type name.   For example, nfs filesystems are
  mounted by the program <i>/sbin/mount</i><b>_</b><i>nfs</i>.

  <b>-u</b>  The <b>-u</b> flag indicates that the status of an already mounted file
  system should be changed.  Any of the options discussed above
  (the <b>-o</b> option) can be changed; also a file system can be changed
  from read-only to read-write or vice versa.  An attempt to change
  from read-write to read-only will fail if any files on the
  filesystem are currently open for writing unless the <b>-f</b> flag is
  also specified.  The set of options is determined by first
  extracting the options for the file system from the fstab table,
  then applying any options specified by the <b>-o</b> argument, and
  finally applying the <b>-r</b> or <b>-w</b> option.

  <b>-v</b>  Verbose mode.

  <b>-w</b>  The file system object is to be read and write.

  The options specific to NFS filesystems are described in the
  <b>mount_nfs(8)</b> manual page.</pre>
<p>The mount command calls the mount(2) system call to prepare and graft a special device or the remote node (rhost:path) on to the file system tree at the point node. If either <span class="code">special</span> or <span class="code">node</span> are not 
provided, the appropriate information is taken from the fstab(5) file.<b><br><br>
