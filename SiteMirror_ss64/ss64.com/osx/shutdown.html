<p>Close down the system at a given time. <br>
  Shutdown provides an automated shutdown procedure for super-users to nicely 
  notify users when the system is shutting down, saving them from system administrators, 
hackers, and gurus, who would otherwise not bother with such niceties. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      shutdown [-] [-h [-u] | -r | -s | -k] [-o [-n]] <i>time</i> [<i>warning-message</i> ...]

Key
   -h      The system is halted at the specified time.

   -k      Kick everybody off.  The -k option does not actually halt the system, but leaves
           the system multi-user with logins disabled (for all but super-user).

   -n      If the -o is specified, prevent the file system cache from being flushed by pass-
           ing -n option to halt(8) or reboot(8).  This option should probably not be used.

   -o      If -h or -r is specified, shutdown will execute halt(8) or reboot(8) instead of
           sending a signal to launchd(8).

   -r      The system is rebooted at the specified time.

   -s      The system is put to sleep at the specified time.

   -u      The system is halted up until the point of removing system power, but waits
           before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external UPS (uninterruptible
           power supply) can forcibly remove power.  This simulates a dirty shutdown to per-
           mit a later automatic power on. macOS uses this mode automatically with supported
           UPSs in emergency shutdowns.

    <i>time</i>   Time is the time at which shutdown will bring the system down and
           may be the word <b>now</b> (indicating an immediate shutdown) or specify a
           future time in one of two formats: +number, or yymmddhhmm, where
           the year, month, and day may be defaulted to the current system
           values.  The first form brings the system down in <i>number</i> minutes
           and the second at the absolute time specified.

     <i>warning-message</i>
           Any other arguments comprise the warning message that is broadcast
           to users currently logged into the system.

     -     If `-' is supplied as an option, the warning message is read from
           the standard input.</pre>
<p>At intervals, becoming more frequent as apocalypse approaches and starting at ten hours before shutdown, warning messages are displayed on the terminals of all users logged in. </p>
<p>At shutdown time a message is written in the system log, containing the time of shutdown, who initiated the shutdown and the reason. A terminate signal is then sent to launchd to bring the system down to single-user state (depending 
on above options). </p>
<p>A scheduled shutdown can be canceled by killing the shutdown process (a SIGTERM should
suffice).</p>
<p>FILES<br>
<span class="code">/etc/nologin</span> tells login not to let anyone log in <br>
<span class="code">/fastboot</span> tells rc(8) not to run fsck when rebooting<br>
<span class="code">/usr/libexec/upsshutdown</span> - Run a command when the UPS shuts down.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Reboot the machine immediately:<br>
<span class="code">$  sudo shutdown -r now</span></p>
<p>Shutdown the machine in 60 minutes:<br>
<span class="code">$ 
sudo shutdown -h +60</span></p>
