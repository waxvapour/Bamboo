<p>Format and print data.<br>
  Write the formatted <var>arguments</var> to the standard output under the control 
of the <var>format</var>. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      printf <i>format</i> [<i>arguments</i> ...]
</pre>
<p>The
<i>format</i> is a character string which contains three types of objects:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Plain  characters,  which are  simply  copied  to  standard  output.</li>
<li>Character <i>escape</i> sequences, which are converted and copied to the standard output.</li>
<li>Format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next  successive argument. </li>
</ul>
<p>The arguments after the first are treated as strings if the corresponding format is either <span class="code">c, b</span> or <span class="code">s</span> otherwise it is evaluated as a C constant, with the following extensions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> • A leading plus or minus sign is allowed.<br>
• If the leading character is a single or double quote, the value is the ASCII code of the next
character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The <i>format</i> string is reused as often as necessary to satisfy the arguments. Any extra format  specifications are evaluated with zero or the null string.</p>
<p> Character escape sequences are in backslash notation as defined in the ANSI X3.159-1989 (`ANSI C89'),
with extensions. The characters and their meanings are as follows:</p>
<pre>   \a      Write a bell character.
   \b      Write a backspace character.
   \c      Ignore remaining characters in this string.
   \f      Write a form-feed character.
   \n      Write a new-line character.
   \r      Write a carriage return character.
   \t      Write a tab> character.
   \v      Write a vertical tab character.
   \'      Write a single quote character.
   \\      Write a backslash character.
   \<i>num</i>
   \0<i>num</i>   Write an 8-bit character whose ASCII value is the 1-, 2-, or 3-digit octal number <i>num</i>.
</pre>
<p>Each format specification is introduced by the percent character (`%').  The remainder of the format
specification includes, in the following order:</p>
<pre>     Zero or more of the following flags:

             #       A `#' character specifying that the value should be printed in an `alternate form'.
                     For c, d, and s, formats, this option has no effect.  For the o formats the precision
                     of the number is increased to force the first character of the output string to a zero.
                     For the x (X) format, a non-zero result has the string 0x (0X) prepended to it.  For e,
                     E, f, g, and G, formats, the result will always contain a decimal point, even if no
                     digits follow the point (normally, a decimal point only appears in the results of those
                     formats if a digit follows the decimal point).  For g and G formats, trailing zeros are
                     not removed from the result as they would otherwise be;

             -       A minus sign specifies left adjustment of the output in the indicated field;

             +       Always place a sign before the number when using signed formats.

             ` '     A space specifying that a blank should be left before a positive number for a signed
                     format.  A `+' overrides a space if both are used;

             0       Use zero-padding rather than blank-padding.  A - overrides a 0 if both are used.

     Field Width:
             An optional digit string specifying a field width; if the output string has fewer characters
             than the field width it will be blank-padded on the left (or right, if the left-adjustment
             indicator has been given) to make up the field width (note that a leading zero is a flag, but
             an embedded zero is part of a field width);

     Precision:
             An optional period, `.', followed by an optional digit string giving a precision which specifies
             fies the number of digits to appear after the decimal point, for e and f formats, or the maximum
             number of characters to be printed from a string; if the digit string is missing, the precision
             is treated as zero;

     Format:
             A character which indicates the type of <i>format</i> to use (one of <b>diouxXfFeEgGaAcsb</b>).  The uppercase
             formats differ from their lowercase counterparts only in that the output of the former is
             entirely in uppercase.  The floating-point format specifiers (fFeEgGaA) can  be prefixed by an <b>L</b>
             to request that additional precision be used, if available.

     A field width or precision can  be `*' instead of a digit string.  In this case an argument supplies the
     field width or precision.

     The <i>format</i> characters and their meanings are:

     diouXx      The argument is printed as a signed decimal (d or i), unsigned octal, unsigned decimal, or
                 unsigned hexadecimal (X or x), respectively.

     fF          The argument is printed in the style `[-]ddd.ddd' where the number of d's after the decimal
                 point is equal to the precision specification for the argument.  If the precision is missing,
                 , 6 digits are given; if the precision is explicitly 0, no digits and no decimal point
                 are printed.  The values infinity and NaN are printed as `inf' and `nan', respectively.

     eE          The argument is printed in the style e `[-d.ddd+-dd]' where there is one digit before the
                 decimal point and the number after is equal to the precision specification for the argument
                 when the precision is missing, 6 digits are produced.  The values infinity and NaN
                 are printed as `inf' and `nan', respectively.

     gG          The argument is printed in style f (F) or in style e (E) whichever gives full precision in
                 minimum space.

     aA          The argument is printed in style `[-h.hhh+-pd]' where there is one digit before the hexadecimal
                 point and the number after is equal to the precision specification for the argument;
                 when the precision is missing, enough digits are produced to convey the argument's
                 exact double-precision floating-point representation.  The values infinity and NaN are
                 printed as `inf' and `nan', respectively.

     c           The first character of argument is printed.

     s           Characters from the string argument are printed until the end is reached or until the number
                 of characters indicated by the precision specification is reached; however if the precision
                 is 0 or missing, all characters in the string are printed.

     b           As for s, but interpret character escapes in backslash notation in the string argument.

     %           Print a `%'; no argument is used.

     The decimal point character is defined in the program's locale (category LC_NUMERIC).

printf "This is `uname -s` running on a `uname -m` processor.\n\n"

<span class="body">Convert a hex number to decimal</span>
$ printf "%d\n " 0xF
15

<span class="body">Convert a decimal number to Hex</span>
printf "0x%X\n " 15

<span class="body">Convert a decimal number to Octal</span>

<span class="body">Convert an Octal  number to </span><span class="body">decimal</span>

# 8</pre>
<p>In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a field; padding takes place only if the specified field width exceeds the actual width.</p>
<p>Since the floating point numbers are translated from ASCII to floating- point and then back again, floating-point precision can  be lost. (By default, the number is translated to an IEEE-754 double-pre-cision double-precision<br>
cision value before being printed. The <span class="code">L</span> modifier might produce additional precision, depending on the
hardware platform.)</p>
<p> ANSI hexadecimal character constants were deliberately not provided.</p>
<p> The escape sequence <span class="code">\000</span> is the string terminator. When present in the argument for the b format, the argument will be truncated at the<span class="code"> \000</span> character.</p>
<p> Multibyte characters are not recognized in format strings (this is only a problem if `%' can appear inside a multibyte character).</p>
<p>Exits 0 on success, 1 on failure.</p>
<p> printf is a bash builtin command.</p>
