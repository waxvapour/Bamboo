<p>Enable or Disable crash reporting via <span class="code">launchtl</span>.</p>
<pre>Syntax

      To disable crash reporting:

      launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ReportCrash.plist
      sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ReportCrash.Root.plist

      To re-enable crash reporting:

      launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ReportCrash.plist
      sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ReportCrash.Root.plist</pre>
<p>ReportCrash analyzes crashing processes and saves a crash report to disk.  A crash report contains information that can help a developer diagnose the cause of a crash.
ReportCrash also records the identity of the crashing process and the location of the saved crash report in the system.log and the ASL log database.</p>
<p>ReportCrash is invoked automatically by <span class="code">launchd</span> when a crash is detected.  For applications and other processes running in the per-user launchd context, ReportCrash runs as a
LaunchAgent and saves crash reports in the user's<span class="code"> ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/</span> directory.  </p>
<p>For daemons, other processes running in the system launchd context and other
privileged processes, ReportCrash runs as a LaunchDaemon and saves crash reports in the system's <span class="code">/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports</span> directory where they are only readable by admin users.  If there are too many crash reports saved for a particular process, older reports will automatically be removed in order to conserve disk space.</p>
<p>For application crashes (but not background process crashes) ReportCrash will display a      dialog notifying the user that the application unexpectedly quit and offering to reopen      the application or send the report to Apple.  For developers, the behavior of this dialog      can be adjusted using <span class="code">/Developer/Applications/Utilities/CrashReporterPrefs.app</span> which is      installed as part of the developer tools. </p>
<p>Crash reports which are sent to Apple are submitted anonymously by the SubmitDiagInfo      process.  The reports are used by Apple to improve its products.  </p>
