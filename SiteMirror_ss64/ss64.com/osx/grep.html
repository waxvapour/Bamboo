<p>Search file(s) for specific text.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      grep &lt;options&gt; &quot;Search String&quot; [<i>filename</i>]

      grep &lt;options&gt; [-e <i>PATTERN</i>] [<i>FILE</i>...]

      grep &lt;options&gt; [-f <i>FILE</i>] [<i>FILE</i>...]

A simple example
grep   &quot;Needle in a Haystack&quot;  /etc/*</pre>
<p>Grep searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files 
  are named, or the file name - is given) for lines containing a match to the 
  given PATTERN. By default, grep prints the matching lines. </p>
<p>In addition, two 
  variant programs <span class="code">egrep</span> and <span class="code">fgrep</span> are available. Egrep is the same as <span class="code">grep -E</span>. 
  Fgrep is the same as <span class="code">grep -F</span>. </p>
<pre>Options
   -A <i>NUM</i>
   --after-context=<i>NUM</i>
       Print <i>NUM</i> lines of trailing context after matching lines.
       Places a line containing -- between contiguous groups of matches. 
   -a
   --text
       Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent
       to the --binary-files=text option.

   -B <i>NUM
  </i> --before-context=<i>NUM</i>
       Print <i>NUM</i> lines of leading context before matching lines.
       Places a line containing -- between contiguous groups of matches.

   -b
   --byte-offset
       Print the byte offset within the input file before each line of output. 

   --colour[=<i>WHEN</i>]
   --color[=<i>WHEN</i>]
       Surround the matching string with the marker from the GREP_COLOR environment variable.
       WHEN can be 'never', 'always', or 'auto' e.g. --color=always<br>       By default the matched text will be colored red.
       If grep is made to match several strings, all of the matches will be colored, one exception
       is the regex ^ (match beginning of every line), the beginning of a line has no length so will
       not be coloued.
       So to return all lines and colour only matches: egrep --color=always '^|string1|string2'

   -C <i>NUM</i>
   --context=<i>NUM</i>
       Print NUM lines of output context.
       Print num lines of leading and trailing context surrounding each match.
       The default is 2 and is equivalent to -A 2 -B 2.
       Note: no whitespace may be given between the option and its argument.

   -c
   --count
       Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.
       With the -v, --invert-match option (see below), count non-matching lines.

   -D <i>ACTION</i>
   --devices=<i>ACTION</i>
       If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use <i>ACTION</i> to process it.
       By default, <i>ACTION</i> is read, which means that devices are read just as if they were
       ordinary files. If <i>ACTION</i> is skip, devices are silently skipped.

   -d <i>ACTION</i>
   --directories=<i>ACTION</i>
       If an input file is a directory, use <i>ACTION</i> to process it.
       By default, <i>ACTION</i> is read, which means that directories are read just as if they
       were ordinary files. If <i>ACTION</i> is skip, directories are silently skipped.
       If <i>ACTION</i> is recurse, grep reads all files under each directory, recursively; this
       is equivalent to the -R and -r option.

   -E
   --extended-regexp
       Interpret <a href="grep-pattern.html">PATTERN</a> as an extended regular expression

   -e <i>PATTERN</i>
   --regexp=<i>PATTERN</i>
       Use<a href="grep-pattern.html"> PATTERN </a>as the pattern; useful to protect patterns beginning with -

   --exclude
       If specified, it excludes files matching the given filename pattern from
       the search.  Note that --exclude patterns take priority over --include patterns,
       and if no --include pattern is specified, all files are searched that are not excluded.
       Patterns are matched to the full path specified, not only to the filename component.

   --exclude-dir
       If -R is specified, it excludes directories matching the given filename pattern from
       the search.  Note that --exclude-dir patterns take priority over --include-dir patterns,
       and if no --include-dir pattern is specified, all directories are searched that are not excluded.

   -F
   --fixed-strings
       Interpret<a href="grep-pattern.html"> PATTERN </a>as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines,
       any of which is to be matched.

   -f <i>FILE</i>
   --file=<i>FILE</i>
       Obtain patterns from <i>FILE</i>, one per line. The empty file contains zero
       patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

   -G
   --basic-regexp
       Interpret<a href="grep-pattern.html"> PATTERN </a>as a basic regular expression This is the default.
 
   -H
   --with-filename
       Print the filename for each match. 
   -h
   --no-filename
       Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when multiple files are searched. 
   --help
      Output a brief help message.

   -I
      Process a binary file as if it did not contain matching data; this is
      equivalent to the --binary-files=without-match option.
   -i
   --ignore-case
      Ignore case distinctions in both the <i>PATTERN</i> and the input files.

   --include
      If specified, only files matching the given filename pattern are searched.
      Note that --exclude patterns take priority over --include patterns.  Patterns are
      matched to the full path specified, not only to the filename component.

   --include-dir
      If -R is specified, only directories matching the given filename pattern are searched.
      Note that --exclude-dir patterns take priority over --include-dir patterns.

   -J, --bz2decompress
      Decompress the bzip2(1) compressed file before looking for the text.

   -L
   --files-without-match
      Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which
      no output would normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the first match. 
   -l
   --files-with-matches
      Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which
      output would normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the first match.

   --mmap
      Use mmap(2) instead of read(2) to read input, which can result in better performance under
      some circumstances but can cause undefined behaviour.

   -m <i>NUM</i>
   --max-count=<i>NUM</i>
      Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.
      If the input is standard input from a regular file, and NUM matching lines are
      output, grep ensures that the standard input is positioned to just after the last
      matching line before exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing context lines.
      This enables a calling process to resume a search. When grep stops after <i>NUM</i> matching
      lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.
      When the -c or --count option is also used, grep does not output a count greater
      than <i>NUM</i>. When the -v or --invert-match option is also used, grep stops after
      outputting <i>NUM</i> non-matching lines. 

   -n
   --line-number
      Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input file. 

   --null   Print a zero-byte after the file name.

   -O
      If -R is specified, follow symbolic links only if they were explicitly listed on the
      command line.  The default is not to follow symbolic links.

   -o
   --only-matching
      Show only the part of a matching line that matches <i>PATTERN</i>.

   -p
      If -R is specified, no symbolic links are followed.  This is the default.

   -q
   --quiet
   --silent
      Quiet mode: suppress normal output.  grep will only search a file until a match
      has been found, making searches potentially less expensive.

   -R
   -r
   --recursive
      Read all files under each directory, recursively
      This is equivalent to the <b>-d recurse</b> option. 

   -s
   --no-messages
      Silent mode.  Nonexistent and unreadable files are ignored
      (i.e. their error messages are suppressed).

   -U
   --binary
      Search binary files, but do not attempt to print them.

   -V
   --version
      Display version information and exit.

   -v
   --invert-match
      Selected lines are those not matching any of the specified patterns.

   -w
    --word-regexp
      The expression is searched for as a word
      (as if surrounded by `[[:&lt;:]]' and `[[:&gt;:]]'; see re_format(7)).

   -x
   --line-regexp
      Only input lines selected against an entire fixed string or regular expression
      are considered to be matching lines.

   -y      Equivalent to -i.  Obsoleted.

   -Z
   -z
   --decompress
      Force grep to behave as zgrep.

   --binary-files=<i>value</i>
      Controls searching and printing of binary files.  Options are <u>binary</u>, the
      default: search binary files but do not print them; <u>without-match</u>: do not search
      binary files; and <u>text</u>: treat all files as text.

   --context[=<i>num</i>]
      Print <i>num</i> lines of leading and trailing context.  The default is 2.

   --line-buffered
      Force output to be line buffered.  By default, output is line buffered
      when standard output is a terminal and block buffered otherwise.</pre>
<p> If no file arguments are specified, the standard input is used.</p>
<p>Grep stands for: Global Regular Expression Print.</p>
<h2> Environment variables</h2>
<blockquote>
<p> Grep's behavior can be affected by setting the following environment variables<br>
</p>
<pre>
GREP_OPTIONS                 - default options
LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG    - language for messages
LC_CTYPE                     - foreign characters
POSIXLY_CORRECT              - Posix behaviour
_N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_ - ignore an operand

see `info grep' for more</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Exit Status</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>grep exits with one of the following values:</p>
<pre>
   0     One or more lines were selected.
   1     No lines were selected.
   >1    An error occurred - syntax error in <i>pattern</i>, inaccessible input files, or other system error.</pre>
<p>In other words a failure to find a matching item is reported as an error (1) </p>
<p>The `-v' option can be used to effectively invert the exit status.</p>
<p>Searching an entire hard drive with grep can be very slow, using <a href="mdfind.html">mdfind</a> to identify files containing text is orders of magnitude <a href="https://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100320112701285">faster</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Search the file example.txt, including binary data (-a) for the string 'hunting the snark':</p>
<p class="code">$ sudo grep -a  'hunting the snark' example.txt</p>
<p>Search the whole partition (/disk0), including binary data (-a) for the string 'hunting the snark' return all the lines<br>
starting 25 <b>B</b>efore the text found and 50 lines <b>A</b>fter the matching text found, this can be a way to discover fragments of deleted files:</p>
<p><span class="code">$ sudo grep -a -B 25 -A 50 'hunting the snark' /dev/disk0</span>&gt; results.txt</p>
<p>Search the file <span class="code">wordlist.txt</span> for any lines that <b>don't </b>include at least one vowel:</p>
<p class="code">$ grep -v [aeiou] wordlist.txt</p>
<p>Remove lines from <span class="code">invoices.txt</span> if they appear in <span class="code">paid.txt</span>:</p>
<p class="code">$ grep -F -x -v -f paid.txt invoices.txt &gt;paidinvoices.txt</p>
<p>List all the file <a href="../bash/alias.html">links</a> in the current folder - in the ouptut of <span class="code">ls</span> each symbolic directory has<span class="code"> l </span>permission at the begining of the permission flags, so <span class="code">grep ^l </span>will list only symbolic links:<br>
<span class="code">$ ls -lR | grep ^l</span><br>
A less cryptic method is to use <span class="code">find . -type l</span></p>
