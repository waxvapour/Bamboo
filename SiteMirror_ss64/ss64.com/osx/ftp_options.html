<pre>Syntax
      ftp [<i>options</i>] -u <i>url file </i>[...]

Advanced Options

     -A        Force active mode ftp.  By default, ftp will try to use passive
        mode ftp and fall back to active mode if passive is not sup-
        ported by the server.  This option causes ftp to always use an
        active connection.  It is only useful for connecting to very old
        servers that do not implement passive mode properly.

     -a        Causes ftp to bypass normal login procedure, and use an anonymous
               login instead.

     -d        Enables debugging.

     -e        Disables command line editing.  This is useful for Emacs angeftp mode.

     -f        Forces a cache reload for transfers that go through the FTP or
               HTTP proxies.

     -g        Disables file name globbing.

     -i        Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

     -n        Restrain ftp from attempting `auto-login' upon initial con-
        nection.  If auto-login is enabled, ftp will check the .netrc
        (see below) file in the user's home directory for an entry
        describing an account on the remote machine.  If no entry
        exists, ftp will prompt for the remote machine login name
        (default is the user identity on the local machine), and, if
        necessary, prompt for a password and an account with which to
        login.

     -o <i>output</i>
        When auto-fetching files, save the contents in <i>output</i>.  output
        is parsed according to the FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS below.   If
        output is not `-' or doesn't start with `|', then only the first
        file specified will be retrieved into output; all other files
        will be retrieved into the basename of their remote name.

     -p       Enable passive mode operation for use behind connection filter-
        ing firewalls.  This option has been deprecated as ftp now tries
        to use passive mode by default, falling back to active mode if
        the server does not support passive connections.

     -P <i>port</i>  Sets the port number to port.

     -r <i>wait</i>  Retry the connection attempt if it failed, pausing for wait sec-
        onds.

     -R       Restart all non-proxied auto-fetches.

     -t       Enables packet tracing.

     -T <i>direction,maximum</i>[,<i>increment</i>]
        Set the maximum transfer rate for direction to maximum
        bytes/second, and if specified, the increment to increment
        bytes/second.  Refer to rate for more information.

     -u <i>url</i> <i>file</i> [...]
        Upload files on the command line to url where url is one of the
        ftp URL types as supported by auto-fetch (with an optional tar-
        get filename for single file uploads), and file is one or more
        local files to be uploaded.

     -v        Enable verbose and progress.  This is the default if output is
        to a terminal (and in the case of progress, ftp is the fore-
        ground process).  Forces ftp to show all responses from the
        remote server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

     -V        Disable verbose and progress, overriding the default of enabled
        when output is to a terminal.</pre>
<p><span class="body">The client host with which ftp is to communicate can be 
  specified on the command line. If this is done, ftp will immediately attempt 
  to establish a connection to an FTP server on that host; otherwise, ftp will 
  enter its command interpreter and await instructions from the user. When ftp 
  is awaiting commands from the user the prompt `ftp>' is provided to the user.</span> 
  <br>
</p>
<pre>The following commands are recognized by ftp:</pre>
<pre>     ! [command [<i>args</i>]]
     Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there
     are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute
     directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

     $ macro-name [<i>args</i>]
     Execute the macro macro-name that was defined with the macdef
     command.  Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.

     account [<i>passwd</i>]
     Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
     for access to resources once a login has been successfully
     completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be
     prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

     append <i>local-file</i> [<i>remote-file</i>]
     Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If
     remote-file is left unspecified, the local file name is used
     in naming the remote file after being altered by any ntrans
     or nmap setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for
     type, format, mode, and structure.

     ascii   Set the file transfer type to network ASCII.  This is the
     default type.

     bell   Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer com-
     mand is completed.

     binary   Set the file transfer type to support binary image transfer.

     bye    Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit ftp.
            An end of file will also terminate the session and exit.

     case   Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during mget
     commands.  When case is on (default is off), remote computer
     file names with all letters in upper case are written in the
     local directory with the letters mapped to lower case.

     cd <i>remote-directory</i>
     Change the working directory on the remote machine to
     remote-directory.

     cdup   Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of
            the current remote machine working directory.

     chmod <i>mode remote-file</i>
             Change the permission modes of the file remote-file on the
             remote system to <i>mode</i>.

     close   Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return
             to the command interpreter.  Any defined macros are erased.

     cr     Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file
     retrieval.  Records are denoted by a carriage return/linefeed
     sequence during ascii type file transfer.  When cr is on (the
     default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence to
     conform with the UNIX single linefeed record delimiter.
     Records on non-UNIX remote systems can contain single line-
     feeds; when an ascii type transfer is made, these linefeeds
     might be distinguished from a record delimiter only when cr is
     off.

     debug [<i>debug-value</i>]
     Toggle debugging mode.   If an optional debug-value is speci-
     fied it is used to set the debugging level.  When debugging
     is on, ftp prints each command sent to the remote machine,
     preceded by the string `-->'

     delete <i>remote-file</i>
     Delete the file remote-file on the remote machine.

     dir [<i>remote-path [local-file</i>]]
     Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote
     machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent informa-
     tion that the server chooses to include; for example, most
     UNIX systems will produce output from the command `ls -l'.
     If remote-path is left unspecified, the current working
     directory is used.  If interactive prompting is on, ftp will
     prompt the user to verify that the last argument is indeed
     the target local file for receiving dir output.  If no local
     file is specified, or if local-file is `-', the output is
     sent to the terminal.

     disconnect   A synonym for close.

     edit   Toggle command line editing, and context sensitive command
     and file completion.  This is automatically enabled if input
     is from a terminal, and disabled otherwise.

     epsv4   Toggle the use of the extended EPSV and EPRT commands on IPv4
     connections; first try EPSV / EPRT, and then PASV / PORT.
     This is enabled by default.  If an extended command fails
     then this option will be temporarily disabled for the dura-
     tion of the current connection, or until epsv4 is executed
     again.

     exit   A synonym for bye.

     features   Display what features the remote server supports (using the
     FEAT command).

     fget <i>localfile</i>
                Retrieve the files listed in localfile, which has one line
                per filename.

     form <i>format</i>
                Set the file transfer form to <i>format</i>.  The default format is 'file'.

     ftp <i>host</i> [<i>port</i>]
                A synonym for open.

     gate [<i>host</i> [<i>port</i>]]
     Toggle gate-ftp mode, which used to connect through the TIS
     FWTK and Gauntlet ftp proxies.   This will not be permitted if
     the gate-ftp server hasn't been set (either explicitly by the
     user, or from the FTPSERVER environment variable).  If host
     is given, then gate-ftp mode will be enabled, and the gate-
     ftp server will be set to host.  If port is also given, that
     will be used as the port to connect to on the gate-ftp
     server.

     get <i>remote-file</i> [<i>local-file</i>]
     Retrieve the remote-file and store it on the local machine.
     If the local file name is not specified, it is given the same
     name it has on the remote machine, subject to alteration by
     the current case, ntrans, and nmap settings.  The current
     settings for type, form, mode, and structure are used while
     transferring the file.

     glob   Toggle filename expansion for mdelete, mget and mput.  If
     globbing is turned off with glob, the file name arguments are
     taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for mput is done
     as in csh(1).  For mdelete and mget, each remote file name is
     expanded separately on the remote machine and the lists are
     not merged.  Expansion of a directory name is likely to be
     different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the
     exact result depends on the foreign operating system and ftp
     server, and can be previewed by doing `mls remote-files -'
     Note: mget and mput are not meant to transfer entire direc-
     tory subtrees of files.  That can be done by transferring a
     tar(1) archive of the subtree (in binary mode).

     hash [<i>size</i>]
     Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each data block trans-
     ferred.  The size of a data block defaults to 1024 bytes.
     This can be changed by specifying size in bytes.  Enabling
     hash disables progress.

     help [<i>command</i>]
     Print an informative message about the meaning of command.
     If no argument is given, ftp prints a list of the known com-
     mands.

     idle [<i>seconds</i>]
     Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to seconds sec-
     onds.  If seconds is omitted, the current inactivity timer is
     printed.

     image   A synonym for binary.

     lcd [<i>directory</i>]
     Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no
     directory is specified, the user's home directory is used.

     less file   A synonym for page.

     lpage <i>local-file</i>
     Display local-file with the program specified by the set
     pager option.

     lpwd   Print the working directory on the local machine.

     ls [<i>remote-path </i>[<i>local-file</i>]]
     A synonym for dir.

     macdef <i>macro-name</i>
     Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
     macro-name; a null line (consecutive newline characters in a
     file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates macro
     input mode.  There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total
     characters in all defined macros.  Macros remain defined
     until a close command is executed.  The macro processor
     interprets `$' and `\' as special characters.  A `$' followed
     by a number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding
     argument on the macro invocation command line.   A `$' fol-
     lowed by an `i' signals that macro processor that the execut-
     ing macro is to be looped.  On the first pass `$i' is
     replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation com-
     mand line, on the second pass it is replaced by the second
     argument, and so on.  A `\' followed by any character is
     replaced by that character.  Use the `\' to prevent special
     treatment of the `$'.

     mdelete [<i>remote-files</i>]
     Delete the remote-files on the remote machine.

     mdir <i>remote-files local-file</i>
     Like dir, except multiple remote files can be specified.  If
     interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to ver-
     ify that the last argument is indeed the target local file
     for receiving mdir output.

     mget <i>remote-files</i>
     Expand the remote-files on the remote machine and do a get
     for each file name thus produced.  See glob for details on
     the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be
     processed according to case, ntrans, and nmap settings.
     Files are transferred into the local working directory, which
     can be changed with `lcd directory'; new local directories
     can be created with `! mkdir directory'.

     mkdir <i>directory-name</i>
     Make a directory on the remote machine.

     mls <i>remote-files local-file</i>
     Like ls, except multiple remote files can be specified, and
     the local-file must be specified.  If interactive prompting
     is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the last argu-
     ment is indeed the target local file for receiving mls out-
     put.

     mlsd [<i>remote-path</i>]
     Display the contents of remote-path (which should default to
     the current directory if not given) in a machine-parsable
     form, using MLSD.  The format of display can be changed with
     `remopts mlst ...'.

     mlst [<i>remote-path</i>]
     Display the details about remote-path (which should default
     to the current directory if not given) in a machine-parsable
     form, using MLST.  The format of display can be changed with
     `remopts mlst ...'.

     mode <i>mode-name</i>
     Set the file transfer mode to mode-name.  The default mode is
     ``stream'' mode.

     modtime <i>remote-file</i>
     Show the last modification time of the file on the remote
     machine.

     more <i>file</i>   A synonym for page.

     mput <i>local-files</i>
     Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as argu-
     ments and do a put for each file in the resulting list.  See
     glob for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file names
     will then be processed according to ntrans and nmap settings.

     msend <i>local-files</i>
     A synonym for mput.

     newer <i>remote-file </i>[<i>local-file</i>]
     Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file
     is more recent that the file on the current system.  If the
     file does not exist on the current system, the remote file is
     considered newer.  Otherwise, this command is identical to
     get.

     nlist [<i>remote-path</i> [<i>local-file</i>]]
     A synonym for ls.

     nmap [<i>inpattern outpattern</i>]
     Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no arguments
     are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset.  If
     arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during
     mput commands and put commands issued without a specified
     remote target filename.  If arguments are specified, local
     filenames are mapped during mget commands and get commands
     issued without a specified local target filename.  This com-
     mand is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer
     with different file naming conventions or practices.  The
     mapping follows the pattern set by inpattern and outpattern.
     [Inpattern] is a template for incoming filenames (which might
     have already been processed according to the ntrans and case
     settings).  Variable templating is accomplished by including
     the sequences `$1', `$2', ..., `$9' in inpattern.  Use `\' to
     prevent this special treatment of the `$' character.  All
     other characters are treated literally, and are used to
     determine the nmap [inpattern] variable values.  For example,
     given inpattern $1.$2 and the remote file name "mydata.data",
     $1 would have the value "mydata", and $2 would have the value
     "data".  The outpattern determines the resulting mapped file-
     name.  The sequences `$1', `$2', ...., `$9' are replaced by
     any value resulting from the inpattern template.  The
     sequence `$0' is replace by the original filename.  Addition-
     ally, the sequence `[seq1, seq2]' is replaced by [seq1] if
     seq1 is not a null string; otherwise it is replaced by seq2.
     For example, the command

           nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

     would yield the output filename "myfile.data" for input file-
     names "myfile.data" and "myfile.data.old", "myfile.file" for
     the input filename "myfile", and "myfile.myfile" for the
     input filename ".myfile".  Spaces can be included in
     outpattern, as in the example: `nmap $1 sed "s/  *$//" > $1'
     .  Use the `\' character to prevent special treatment of the
     `$','[',']', and `,' characters.

     ntrans [inchars [outchars]]
     Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.
     If no arguments are specified, the filename character trans-
     lation mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, char-
     acters in remote filenames are translated during mput com-
     mands and put commands issued without a specified remote tar-
     get filename.  If arguments are specified, characters in
     local filenames are translated during mget commands and get
     commands issued without a specified local target filename.
     This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote
     computer with different file naming conventions or practices.
     Characters in a filename matching a character in inchars are
     replaced with the corresponding character in outchars.   If
     the character's position in inchars is longer than the length
     of outchars, the character is deleted from the file name.

     open <i>host</i> [<i>port</i>]
     Establish a connection to the specified host FTP server.  An
     optional port number can be supplied, in which case, ftp will
     attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.   If the
     auto-login option is on (default), ftp will also attempt to
     automatically log the user in to the FTP server (see below).

     page file   Retrieve file and display with the program specified by the
     set pager option.

     passive [<i>auto</i>]
     Toggle passive mode (if no arguments are given).  If auto is
     given, act as if FTPMODE is set to `auto'.  If passive mode
     is turned on (default), ftp will send a PASV command for all
     data connections instead of a PORT command.  The PASV command
     requests that the remote server open a port for the data con-
     nection and return the address of that port.  The remote
     server listens on that port and the client connects to it.
     When using the more traditional PORT command, the client lis-
     tens on a port and sends that address to the remote server,
     who connects back to it.  Passive mode is useful when using
     ftp through a gateway router or host that controls the direc-
     tionality of traffic.  (Note that though FTP servers are
     required to support the PASV command by RFC 1123, some do
     not.)

     pdir [<i>remote-path</i>]
     Perform dir [remote-path], and display the result with the
     program specified by the set pager option.

     pls [<i>remote-path</i>]
     Perform ls [remote-path], and display the result with the
     program specified by the set pager option.

     pmlsd [remote-path]
     Perform mlsd [remote-path], and display the result with the
     program specified by the set pager option.

     preserve   Toggle preservation of modification times on retrieved files.

     progress   Toggle display of transfer progress bar.  The progress bar
     will be disabled for a transfer that has local-file as `-' or
     a command that starts with `|'.  Refer to FILE NAMING
     CONVENTIONS for more information.  Enabling progress disables
     hash.

     prompt   Toggle interactive prompting.  Interactive prompting occurs
     during multiple file transfers to allow the user to selec-
     tively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off
     (default is on), any mget or mput will transfer all files,
     and any mdelete will delete all files.

     When prompting is on, the following commands are available at
     a prompt:

           a   Answer `yes' to the current file, and automatically
         answer `yes' to any remaining files for the current
         command.

           n   Answer `no', and do not transfer the file.

           p   Answer `yes' to the current file, and turn off
         prompt mode (as is ``prompt off'' had been given).

           q   Terminate the current operation.

           y   Answer `yes', and transfer the file.

           ?   Display a help message.

     Any other reponse will answer `yes' to the current file.

     proxy <i>ftp-command</i>
     Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.
     This command allows simultaneous connection to two remote FTP
     servers for transferring files between the two servers.  The
     first proxy command should be an open, to establish the sec-
     ondary control connection.  Enter the command "proxy ?" to
     see other FTP commands executable on the secondary connec-
     tion.  The following commands behave differently when pref-
     aced by proxy: open will not define new macros during the
     auto-login process, close will not erase existing macro defi-
     nitions, get and mget transfer files from the host on the
     primary control connection to the host on the secondary con-
     trol connection, and put, mput, and append transfer files
     from the host on the secondary control connection to the host
     on the primary control connection.  Third party file trans-
     fers depend upon support of the FTP protocol PASV command by
     the server on the secondary control connection.

     put <i>local-file </i>[<i>remote-file</i>]
     Store a local file on the remote machine.  If remote-file is
     left unspecified, the local file name is used after process-
     ing according to any ntrans or nmap settings in naming the
     remote file.  File transfer uses the current settings for
     type, format, mode, and structure.

     pwd   Print the name of the current working directory on the remote
     machine.

     quit   A synonym for bye.

     quote <i>arg1 arg2</i> ...
     The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP
     server.

     rate direction [maximum [increment]]
     Throttle the maximum transfer rate to maximum bytes/second.
     If maximum is 0, disable the throttle.

     direction can be one of:
           all  Both directions.
           get  Incoming transfers.
           put  Outgoing transfers.

     maximum can by modified on the fly by increment bytes
     (default: 1024) each time a given signal is received:

           SIGUSR1  Increment maximum by increment bytes.

           SIGUSR2  Decrement maximum by increment bytes.  The
        result must be a positive number.

     If maximum is not supplied, the current throttle rates are
     displayed.

     Note: rate is not yet implemented for ascii mode transfers.

     rcvbuf <i>size</i>
     Set the size of the socket receive buffer to size.

     recv <i>remote-file</i> [<i>local-file</i>]
     A synonym for get.

     reget <i>remote-file</i> [<i>local-file</i>]
     reget acts like get, except that if local-file exists and is
     smaller than remote-file, local-file is presumed to be a par-
     tially transferred copy of remote-file and the transfer is
     continued from the apparent point of failure.  This command
     is useful when transferring very large files over networks
     that are prone to dropping connections.

     remopts <i>command</i> [<i>command-options</i>]
     Set options on the remote FTP server for command to
     command-options (whose absence is handled on a command-spe-
     cific basis).  Remote FTP commands known to support options
     include: `MLST' (used for MLSD and MLST).

     rename [<i>from</i> [<i>to</i>]]
     Rename the file from on the remote machine, to the file to.

     reset   Clear reply queue.  This command re-synchronizes com-
     mand/reply sequencing with the remote FTP server.  Resynchro-
     nization might be necessary following a violation of the FTP
     protocol by the remote server.

     restart marker
     Restart the immediately following get or put at the indicated
     marker.  On UNIX systems, marker is usually a byte offset
     into the file.

     rhelp [<i>command-name</i>]
     Request help from the remote FTP server.  If a command-name
     is specified it is supplied to the server as well.

     rmdir <i>directory-name</i>
     Delete a directory on the remote machine.

     rstatus [<i>remote-file</i>]
     With no arguments, show status of remote machine.  If
     remote-file is specified, show status of remote-file on
     remote machine.

     runique   Toggle storing of files on the local system with unique file-
     names.   If a file already exists with a name equal to the
     target local filename for a get or mget command, a ".1" is
     appended to the name.  If the resulting name matches another
     existing file, a ".2" is appended to the original name.  If
     this process continues up to ".99", an error message is
     printed, and the transfer does not take place.   The generated
     unique filename will be reported.  Note that runique will not
     affect local files generated from a shell command (see
     below).  The default value is off.

     send <i>local-file </i>[<i>remote-file</i>]
     A synonym for put.

     sendport   Toggle the use of PORT commands.  By default, ftp will
     attempt to use a PORT command when establishing a connection
     for each data transfer.  The use of PORT commands can prevent
     delays when performing multiple file transfers.  If the PORT
     command fails, ftp will use the default data port.  When the
     use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt will be made to
     use PORT commands for each data transfer.  This is useful for
     certain FTP implementations which do ignore PORT commands
     but, incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.

     set [<i>option value</i>]
     Set option to value.  If option and value are not given, dis-
     play all of the options and their values.  The currently sup-
     ported options are:

           anonpass     Defaults to $FTPANONPASS

           ftp_proxy   Defaults to $ftp_proxy.

           http_proxy  Defaults to $http_proxy.

           no_proxy     Defaults to $no_proxy.

           pager     Defaults to $PAGER.

           prompt     Defaults to $FTPPROMPT.

           rprompt     Defaults to $FTPRPROMPT.

     size <i>remote-file</i>
     Return size of remote-file on remote machine.

     sndbuf <i>size</i>
     Set the size of the socket send buffer to size.

     site <i>arg1 arg2</i> ...
     The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP
     server as a SITE command.

     status   Show the current status of ftp.

     struct <i>struct-name</i>
     Set the file transfer structure to struct-name.  By default
     ``stream'' structure is used.

     sunique   Toggle storing of files on remote machine under unique file
     names.   The remote FTP server must support FTP protocol STOU
     command for successful completion.  The remote server will
     report unique name.  Default value is off.

     system   Show the type of operating system running on the remote
     machine.

     tenex   Set the file transfer type to that needed to talk to TENEX
     machines.

     throttle   A synonym for rate.

     trace   Toggle packet tracing.

     type [<i>type-name</i>]
     Set the file transfer type to type-name.  If no type is spec-
     ified, the current type is printed.  The default type is net-
     work ASCII.

     umask [<i>newmask</i>]
     Set the default umask on the remote server to newmask.   If
     newmask is omitted, the current umask is printed.

     unset <i>option</i>
     Unset option.  Refer to set for more information.

     usage <i>command</i>
     Print the usage message for command.

     user <i>user-name </i>[<i>password [account</i>]]
     Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the password
     is not specified and the server requires it, ftp will prompt
     the user for it (after disabling local echo).  If an account
     field is not specified, and the FTP server requires it, the
     user will be prompted for it.  If an account field is speci-
     fied, an account command will be relayed to the remote server
     after the login sequence is completed if the remote server
     did not require it for logging in.  Unless ftp is invoked
     with ``auto-login'' disabled, this process is done automati-
     cally on initial connection to the FTP server.

     verbose   Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose mode, all responses from the
     FTP server are displayed to the user.  In addition, if ver-
     bose is on, when a file transfer completes, statistics
     regarding the efficiency of the transfer are reported.   By
     default, verbose is on.

     xferbuf <i>size</i>
     Set the size of the socket send and receive buffers to size.

ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER

     To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-
     C).  Sending transfers will be immediately halted.   Receiving transfers
     will be halted by sending an FTP protocol ABOR command to the remote
     server, and discarding any further data received.  The speed at which
     this is accomplished depends upon the remote server's support for ABOR
     processing.  If the remote server does not support the ABOR command, the
     prompt will not appear until the remote server has completed sending the
     requested file.

     If the terminal interrupt key sequence is used whilst ftp is awaiting a
     reply from the remote server for the ABOR processing, then the connection
     will be closed.  This is different from the traditional behaviour (which
     ignores the terminal interrupt during this phase), but is considered more
     useful.

<a id="naming"></a>FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p> Files specified as arguments to ftp commands are processed according to
the following rules.<br>
<br>
1.    If the file name `-' is specified, the stdin (for reading) or stdout
(for writing) is used.<br>
<br>
2.    If the first character of the file name is `|', the remainder of the
argument is interpreted as a shell command.  ftp then forks a shell,
using popen(3) with the argument supplied, and reads (writes) from
the stdout (stdin).  If the shell command includes spaces, the argument must be quoted; e.g.  `"| ls -lt"'.  A particularly useful
example of this mechanism is: `dir " |more''.<br>
<br>
3.    Failing the above checks, if `globbing' is enabled, local file
names are expanded according to the rules used in the csh(1); c.f.
the glob command.  If the ftp command expects a single local file
(e.g.   put), only the first filename generated by the "globbing" operation is used.<br>
<br>
4.    For mget commands and get commands with unspecified local file
names, the local filename is the remote filename, which can be
altered by a case, ntrans, or nmap setting.  The resulting filename
can then be altered if runique is on.<br>
<br>
5.    For mput commands and put commands with unspecified remote file
names, the remote filename is the local filename, which can be
altered by a ntrans or nmap setting.  The resulting filename can 
then be altered by the remote server if sunique is on.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>
THE .netrc FILE

     The .netrc file contains login and initialization information used by the
     auto-login process.  It resides in the user's home directory.  The fol-
     lowing tokens are recognized; they can be separated by spaces, tabs, or
     new-lines:

     machine name
         Identify a remote machine name.  The auto-login process
         searches the .netrc file for a machine token that matches the
         remote machine specified on the ftp command line or as an open
         command argument.  Once a match is made, the subsequent .netrc
         tokens are processed, stopping when the end of file is reached
         or another machine or a default token is encountered.

     default   This is the same as machine name except that default matches
         any name.  There can be only one default token, and it must be
         after all machine tokens.  This is normally used as:

         default login anonymous password user@site

         thereby giving the user an automatic anonymous FTP login to
         machines not specified in .netrc.  This can be overridden by
         using the -n flag to disable auto-login.

     login name
         Identify a user on the remote machine.  If this token is pre-
         sent, the auto-login process will initiate a login using the
         specified name.

     password string
         Supply a password.  If this token is present, the auto-login
         process will supply the specified string if the remote server
         requires a password as part of the login process.  Note that if
         this token is present in the .netrc file for any user other
         than anonymous, ftp will abort the auto-login process if the
         .netrc is readable by anyone besides the user.

     account string
         Supply an additional account password.  If this token is pre-
         sent, the auto-login process will supply the specified string
         if the remote server requires an additional account password,
         or the auto-login process will initiate an ACCT command if it
         does not.

     macdef name
         Define a macro.  This token functions like the ftp macdef com-
         mand functions.  A macro is defined with the specified name;
         its contents begin with the next .netrc line and continue until
         a blank line (consecutive new-line characters) is encountered.
         If a macro named init is defined, it is automatically executed
         as the last step in the auto-login process.</pre>
<p> COMMAND LINE EDITING</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ftp supports interactive command line editing, via the editline(3)
library.  It is enabled with the edit command, and is enabled by default
if input is from a tty.  Previous lines can be recalled and edited with
the arrow keys, and other GNU Emacs-style editing keys can be used as
well.<br>
<br>
The editline(3) library is configured with a .editrc file - refer to
editrc(5) for more information.<br>
<br>
An extra key binding is available to ftp to provide context sensitive
command and filename completion (including remote file completion).  To
use this, bind a key to the editline(3) command ftp-complete.  By
default, this is bound to the TAB key.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>
COMMAND LINE PROMPT

     By default, ftp displays a command line prompt of `ftp> ' to the user.
     This can be changed with the set prompt command.

     A prompt can be displayed on the right side of the screen (after the com-
     mand input) with the set rprompt command.

     The following formatting sequences are replaced by the given information:

     %/  The current remote working directory.

     %c[[0]n], %.[[0]n]
    The trailing component of the current remote working direc-
    tory, or n trailing components if a digit n is given.  If n
    begins with `0', the number of skipped components precede the
    trailing component(s) in the format `/<skipped>trailing'
    (for `%c') or `...trailing' (for `%.').

     %M  The remote host name.

     %m  The remote host name, up to the first `.'.

     %n  The remote user name.

     %%  A single `%'.

ENVIRONMENT

     ftp uses the following environment variables.

     FTPANONPASS    Password to send in an anonymous FTP transfer.  Defaults
        to ``whoami`@'

     FTPMODE      Overrides the default operation mode.  Support values are:

        active   active mode FTP only

        auto     automatic determination of passive or active
           (this is the default)

        gate     gate-ftp mode

        passive  passive mode FTP only

     FTPPROMPT      Command-line prompt to use.   Defaults to `ftp> '.   Refer
        to COMMAND LINE PROMPT for more information.

     FTPRPROMPT      Command-line right side prompt to use.  Defaults to `'.
        Refer to COMMAND LINE PROMPT for more information.

     FTPSERVER      Host to use as gate-ftp server when gate is enabled.

     FTPSERVERPORT  Port to use when connecting to gate-ftp server when gate
        is enabled.   Default is port returned by a getservbyname()
        lookup of `ftpgate/tcp'.

     HOME      For default location of a .netrc file, if one exists.

     PAGER      Used by various commands to display files.  Defaults to
        more(1) if empty or not set.

     SHELL      For default shell.

     ftp_proxy      URL of FTP proxy to use when making FTP URL requests (if
        not defined, use the standard FTP protocol).

     http_proxy      URL of HTTP proxy to use when making HTTP URL requests.
        If proxy authentication is required and there is a user-
        name and password in this URL, they will automatically be
        used in the first attempt to authenticate to the proxy.

        Note that the use of a username and password in ftp_proxy
        and http_proxy can be incompatible with other programs
        that use it (such as lynx(1) ).

     no_proxy      A space or comma separated list of hosts (or domains) for
        which proxying is not to be used.  Each entry can have an
        optional trailing ":port", which restricts the matching to
        connections to that port.</pre>
<p>Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behavior by the remote 
  server. </p>
<p>An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode 
  transfer code has been corrected. This correction can result in incorrect transfers 
  of binary files to and from 4.2BSD servers using the ascii type. Avoid this 
  problem by using the binary image type. </p>
<p>ftp assumes that all IPv4 mapped addresses (IPv6 addresses with 
  a form like ::ffff:10.1.1.1) indicate IPv4 destinations which can be handled 
  by AF_INET sockets. However, in certain IPv6 network configurations, this assumption 
  is not true. In such an environment, IPv4 mapped addresses must be passed to 
  AF_INET6 sockets directly. For example, if your site uses a SIIT translator 
  for IPv6-to-IPv4 translation, ftp is unable to support your configuration.</p>
