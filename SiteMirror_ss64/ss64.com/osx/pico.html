<p>Simple text editor, in the style of the Pine Composer. commands 
  are displayed at the bottom of the screen, and context- sensitive help is provided. 
As characters are typed they are immediately inserted into the text. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      pico [<i>options</i>] [<i>file</i>]

Options
       -f     Use  function  keys for commands.	 This option sup-
	      ported only in conjunction with  UW  Enhanced  NCSA
	      telnet.

       +n     Causes pico to be started with the cursor located n
	      lines into the file. (Note: no  space  between  "+"
	      sign and number)

       -nn    The  -nn option enables new mail notification.  The
	      n argument is optional, and specifies how often, in
	      seconds, your mailbox is checked for new mail.  For
	      example, -n60 causes pico to  check  for	new  mail
	      once  every  minute.   The  default interval is 180
	      seconds, while the minimum allowed is 30. (Note: no
	      space between "n" and the number)

       -t     Enable "tool" mode.  Intended for when pico is used
	      as  the  editor  within  other  tools  (e.g.,  Elm,
	      Pnews).  Pico will not prompt for save on exit, and
	      will not rename the buffer during the  "Write  Out"
	      command.

       -v     View the file only, disallowing any editing.

       -w     Disable  word  wrap  (thus  allow	 editing  of long
	      lines).

       -z     Enable ^Z suspension of pico.</pre>
<p>Editing commands are entered using control-key combinations. As 
  a work-around for communications programs that swallow certain control characters, 
  you can emulate a control key by pressing ESCAPE twice, followed by the desired 
  control character, e.g. "ESC ESC c" would be equivalent to entering a ctrl-c. 
  The editor has five basic features: paragraph justification, searching, block 
  cut/paste, a spelling checker, and a file browser. </p>
<p>Paragraph justification (or filling) takes place in the paragraph 
  that contains the cursor, or, if the cursor is between lines, in the paragraph 
  immediately below. Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines, or by lines beginning 
  with a space or tab. Unjustification can be done immedi- ately after justification 
  using the control-U key combination. </p>
<p>String searches are not sensitive to case. A search begins at 
  the current cursor position and wraps around the end of the text. The most recent 
  search string is offered as the default in subsequent searches. </p>
<p>Blocks of text can be moved, copied or deleted with creative use 
  of the command for mark (ctrl-underscore), delete (ctrl-k) and undelete (ctrl-u). 
  The delete command will remove text between the "mark" and the current cursor 
  position, and place it in the "cut" buffer. The undelete command effects a "paste" 
  at the current cursor position. </p>
<p>The spell checker examines all words in the text. It then offers, 
  in turn, each misspelled word for correction while highlighting it in the text. 
  Spell checking can be cancelled at any time. Alternatively, pico will substitute 
  for the default spell checking routine a routine defined by the SPELL environment 
  variable. The replacement routine should read standard input and write standard 
  output. </p>
<p>The file browser is offered as an option in the "Read File" and 
  "Write Out" command prompts. It is intended to help in searching for specific 
  files and navigating directory hierarchies. Filenames with sizes and names of 
  directories in the current working directory are presented for selection. The 
  current working directory is displayed on the top line of the display while 
  the list of available commands takes up the bottom two. Several basic file manipulation 
  functions are supported: file renaming, copying, and deletion. </p>
<p>When a running pico is disconnected (i.e., receives a SIGHUP), 
  pico will save the current work if needed before exiting. Work is saved under 
  the current filename with ".save" appended. If the current work is unnamed, 
  it is saved under the filename "pico.save".</p>
<p>More specific help is available in pico's online help.<b><br>
