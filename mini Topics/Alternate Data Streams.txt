* ADS data will not show increase in file size no matter how big it is
* ADS data will get lost once transferred to another Filesyste like FAT,EXT5 etc

##################### Creating a ADS using cmd ###########################


echo "normal File" > file1.txt			//file1.txt is going to be our host file for storing our ADS File
echo "Alternate data stream Data" > file1.txt:ADS.txt			//ADS.txt is stored in file1.txt's Alternate Data Stream

##################### Reading and finding Files with ADS #################

dir /R 			//this will print Files along with ADS's if Avilable
more <file1.txt:ADS.txt> output.txt			// this will extract ADS data from the file1.txt and will store into output.txt
